| **[CRPO: Confidence-Reward Driven Preference Optimization for Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13927v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language processing tasks, but their application to machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to pretraining on English-centric data and the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both translation accuracy and data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of Indic Language Capabilities in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13912v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report evaluates the performance of text-in text-out Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and generate Indic languages. This evaluation is used to identify and prioritize Indic languages suited for inclusion in safety benchmarks. We conduct this study by reviewing existing evaluation studies and datasets; and a set of twenty-eight LLMs that support Indic languages. We analyze the LLMs on the basis of the training data, license for model and data, type of access and model developers. We also compare Indic language performance across evaluation datasets and find that significant performance disparities in performance across Indic languages. Hindi is the most widely represented language in models. While model performance roughly correlates with number of speakers for the top five languages, the assessment after that varies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[NESTFUL: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Nested Sequences of API Calls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03797v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resurgence of autonomous agents built using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks has brought increased focus on LLMs' fundamental ability of tool or function calling. At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Prompt Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13904v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 main conference track</p></details> |
| **[IrokoBench: A New Benchmark for African Languages in the Age of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03368v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of Large language models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities remain limited to a few high-resource languages. Additionally, many low-resource languages (\eg African languages) are often evaluated only on basic text classification tasks due to the lack of appropriate or comprehensive benchmarks outside of high-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce IrokoBench -- a human-translated benchmark dataset for 17 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks: natural language inference~(AfriXNLI), mathematical reasoning~(AfriMGSM), and multi-choice knowledge-based question answering~(AfriMMLU). We use IrokoBench to evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and translate-test settings~(where test sets are translated into English) across 10 open and six proprietary LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between high-resource languages~(such as English and French) and low-resource African languages. We observe a significant performance gap between open and proprietary models, with the highest performing open model, Gemma 2 27B only at 63\% of the best-performing proprietary model GPT-4o performance. In addition, machine translating the test set to English before evaluation helped to close the gap for larger models that are English-centric, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. These findings suggest that more efforts are needed to develop and adapt LLMs for African languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Finetuned Audio-LLM on Heart Murmur Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13884v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) for audio have excelled in recognizing and analyzing human speech, music, and environmental sounds. However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of audio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, and 3 tables.

| **[A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[RegMix: Data Mixture as Regression for Language Model Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01492v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly impacts performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix trains many small models on diverse data mixtures, uses regression to predict performance of unseen mixtures, and applies the best predicted mixture to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens to fit the regression model and predict the best data mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Furthermore, RegMix consistently outperforms human selection in experiments involving models up to 7B models trained on 100B tokens, while matching or exceeding DoReMi using just 10% of the computational resources. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/regmix.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13833v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have intensified the debate surrounding the fundamental nature of their reasoning capabilities. While achieving high performance on benchmarks such as GPQA and MMLU, these models exhibit limitations in more complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel phenomenological approach that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to probe the underlying mechanisms of model behavior, establishing a framework that could broadly impact how we analyze and understand AI systems. Using positional bias in multiple-choice reasoning tasks as a case study, we demonstrate how systematic perturbations can reveal fundamental aspects of model decision-making. To analyze these behaviors, we develop two complementary phenomenological models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that decomposes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing components and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis that quantifies the relationship between model confidence and strategy selection. Through controlled experiments on reasoning benchmarks, we show that true reasoning remains challenging for current models, with apparent success often relying on sophisticated combinations of memorization and pattern matching rather than genuine logical deduction. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that accuracy alone often overstates a model's reasoning abilities, as model behavior can be characterized through underlying mechanisms in the phase space of cognitive strategies, revealing how models dynamically balance different approaches when responding to queries. This framework enables quantitative criteria for real-world deployments, allowing applications to specify reliability thresholds based on strategy distributions rather than aggregate performance metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Compact Phrasal Rewrites with Large Language Models for ASR Post Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13831v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at rewriting tasks such as text style transfer and grammatical error correction. While there is considerable overlap between the inputs and outputs in these tasks, the decoding cost still increases with output length, regardless of the amount of overlap. By leveraging the overlap between the input and the output, Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) proposed model-agnostic edit span representations to compress the rewrites to save computation. They reported an output length reduction rate of nearly 80% with minimal accuracy impact in four rewriting tasks. In this paper, we propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation. We systematically compare our phrasal representations with their span representations. We apply the LLM rewriting model to the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post editing and show that our target-phrase-only edit representation has the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off. On the LibriSpeech test set, our method closes 50-60% of the WER gap between the edit span model and the full rewrite model while losing only 10-20% of the length reduction rate of the edit span model.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13824v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concerns about hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been raised by researchers, yet their potential in areas where creativity is vital, such as drug discovery, merits exploration. In this paper, we come up with the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. To verify this hypothesis, we use LLMs to describe the SMILES string of molecules in natural language and then incorporate these descriptions as part of the prompt to address specific tasks in drug discovery. Evaluated on seven LLMs and five classification tasks, our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs can achieve better performance with text containing hallucinations. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the baseline without hallucination. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the most consistent improvements across models. Additionally, we conduct empirical analyses and a case study to investigate key factors affecting performance and the underlying reasons. Our research sheds light on the potential use of hallucinations for LLMs and offers new perspectives for future research leveraging LLMs in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model driven Policy Exploration for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13816v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Recommender Systems (RS) have incorporated Reinforcement Learning (RL), framing the recommendation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, offline RL policies trained on static user data are vulnerable to distribution shift when deployed in dynamic online environments. Additionally, excessive focus on exploiting short-term relevant items can hinder exploration, leading to suboptimal recommendations and negatively impacting long-term user gains. Online RL-based RS also face challenges in production deployment, due to the risks of exposing users to untrained or unstable policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to mimic user objectives and preferences for pre-training policies offline to enhance the initial recommendations in online settings. Effectively managing distribution shift and balancing exploration are crucial for improving RL-based RS, especially when leveraging LLM-based pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose an Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP) that utilizes user preferences distilled from an LLM. Our approach involves prompting the LLM with user states to extract item preferences, learning rewards based on feedback, and updating the RL policy using an actor-critic framework. Furthermore, to deploy iALP in an online scenario, we introduce an adaptive variant, A-iALP, that implements a simple fine-tuning strategy (A-iALP$_{ft}$), and an adaptive approach (A-iALP$_{ap}$) designed to mitigate issues with compromised policies and limited exploration. Experiments across three simulated environments demonstrate that A-iALP introduces substantial performance improvements</p></details> |  |

However, implementing AI within IT operations is not without its challenges, including issues related to data quality, the complexity of IT environments, and skill gaps within teams. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to address some of these challenges, particularly through their advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These features enable organizations to process and analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, such as system logs, incident reports, and technical documentation. This ability aligns with the motivation behind our research, where we aim to integrate traditional predictive machine learning models with generative AI technologies like LLMs. By combining these approaches, we propose innovative methods to tackle persistent challenges in AIOps and enhance the capabilities of IT operations management.</p></details> |  |

In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation compared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of proprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in classifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as incorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks that require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation, and 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to engage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading claims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AI Governance Workshop at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

The feedback loop is complete when the user interacts with the displayed data. Mathematical formulas are used to quantify the performance of the model that revolves around core evaluation points: accuracy, coherence, and latency during ASR speech-to-text conversion.

We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the topology of data itself informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.</p></details> |  |

Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Do Large Language Models Truly Understand Geometric Structures?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13773v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric ability is a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for advanced spatial comprehension and abstract thinking. Existing datasets primarily evaluate LLMs on their final answers, but they cannot truly measure their true understanding of geometric structures, as LLMs can arrive at correct answers by coincidence. To fill this gap, we introduce the GeomRel dataset, designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of geometric structures by isolating the core step of geometric relationship identification in problem-solving. Using this benchmark, we conduct thorough evaluations of diverse LLMs and identify key limitations in understanding geometric structures. We further propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which enhances LLMs' ability to identify geometric relationships, resulting in significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.</p></details> |  |

The impact of longer contexts on mathematical reasoning remains under-explored. This study pioneers the investigation of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), which refers to the ability of LLMs to solve MWPs with extended narratives. We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs featuring lengthy narratives, and propose two novel metrics to evaluate the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in tackling these problems. Our analysis of existing zero-shot prompting techniques with proprietary LLMs along with open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG. To alleviate these issues, we propose tailored approaches for different categories of LLMs. For proprietary LLMs, we introduce a new instructional prompt designed to mitigate the impact of long contexts. For open-source LLMs, we develop a novel auxiliary task for fine-tuning to enhance CoLeG. Our comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing improved performance on E-GSM. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis to differentiate the effects of semantic understanding and reasoning efficacy, showing that our methods improves the latter. We also establish the generalizability of our methods across several other MWP benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs and offer practical solutions correspondingly, paving the way for further exploration of model generalizability and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we evaluate the ability of Llama-3 at attributing utterances of direct-speech to their speaker in novels. The LLM shows impressive results on a corpus of 28 novels, surpassing published results with ChatGPT and encoder-based baselines by a large margin. We then validate these results by assessing the impact of book memorization and annotation contamination.

Various methods have been developed to counteract phishing, each with varying levels of accuracy, but they also face notable limitations. In this study, we introduce PhishAgent, a multimodal agent that combines a wide range of tools, integrating both online and offline knowledge bases with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand recognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information retrieval framework designed to extract the relevant top k items from offline knowledge bases, using available information from a webpage, including logos and HTML. Our empirical results, based on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while maintaining model efficiency.

The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by TOSEM</p></details> |

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks. However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs. Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code. The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter. We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Large language models (LLMs) struggle to evaluate the correctness of non-parametric knowledge retrieved externally when it differs from internal memorization, leading to knowledge conflicts during response generation. To this end, we introduce the Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), a lightweight and effective alignment method to adaptively leverage multi-source knowledge based on retrieval relevance. An implicit representation of retrieval relevance is derived and incorporated into the reward model to integrate retrieval evaluation and response generation into a single model, solving the problem that previous methods necessitate the additional procedure to assess the retrieval quality. Notably, RPO is the only RAG-dedicated alignment approach that quantifies the awareness of retrieval relevance in training, overcoming mathematical obstacles. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that RPO outperforms RAG by 4-10% in accuracy without any extra component, exhibiting its robust generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, such as proxy encoding and geometry encoding, incorporate additional syntax to encode spatial information, imposing extra burdens when communicating between language and vision modules. In this study, we propose ClawMachine, offering a new methodology that explicitly notates each entity using token collectives groups of visual tokens that collaboratively represent higher level semantics. A hybrid perception mechanism is also explored to perceive and understand scenes from both discrete and continuous spaces. Our method unifies the prompt and answer of visual referential tasks without using additional syntax. By leveraging a joint vision-language vocabulary, ClawMachine further integrates referring and grounding in an auto-regressive manner, demonstrating great potential with scaled-up pre-training data. Experiments show that ClawMachine achieves superior performance on scene-level and referential understanding tasks with higher efficiency. It also exhibits the potential to integrate multi-source information for complex visual reasoning, which is beyond the capability of many MLLMs. Our code is available at github.com/martian422/ClawMachine.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.</p></details> |  |

The subjectivity of discomfort and the black-box nature of these algorithms make it challenging to effectively identify and filter such content. To address this, we first conducted a formative study to understand users' practices and expectations regarding discomforting recommendation filtering. Then, we designed a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tool named DiscomfortFilter, which constructs an editable preference profile for a user and helps the user express filtering needs through conversation to mask discomforting preferences within the profile. Based on the edited profile, DiscomfortFilter facilitates the discomforting recommendations filtering in a plug-and-play manner, maintaining flexibility and transparency. The constructed preference profile improves LLM reasoning and simplifies user alignment, enabling a 3.8B open-source LLM to rival top commercial models in an offline proxy task. A one-week user study with 24 participants demonstrated the effectiveness of DiscomfortFilter, while also highlighting its potential impact on platform recommendation outcomes. We conclude by discussing the ongoing challenges, highlighting its relevance to broader research, assessing stakeholder impact, and outlining future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025, 16 pages, full version</p></details> |

Existing studies highlight that dependency-related issues cause over 40\% of observed runtime errors on the generated repository. To address this, we introduce DI-BENCH, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability on dependency inference. The benchmark features 581 repositories with testing environments across Python, C#, Rust, and JavaScript. Extensive experiments with textual and execution-based metrics reveal that the current best-performing model achieves only a 42.9% execution pass rate, indicating significant room for improvement. DI-BENCH establishes a new viewpoint for evaluating LLM performance on repositories, paving the way for more robust end-to-end software synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Despite the wealth of information in these records, their complexity and volume make it difficult for users to retrieve and interpret crucial health insights. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution, enabling semantic question answering (QA) over medical data, allowing users to interact with their health records more effectively. However, ensuring privacy and compliance requires edge and private deployments of LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic QA over EHRs by first identifying the most relevant FHIR resources for a user query (Task1) and subsequently answering the query based on these resources (Task2). We explore the performance of privately hosted, fine-tuned LLMs, evaluating them against benchmark models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, while 250x smaller in size, outperform GPT-4 family models by 0.55% in F1 score on Task1 and 42% on Meteor Task in Task2. Additionally, we examine advanced aspects of LLM usage, including sequential fine-tuning, model self-evaluation (narcissistic evaluation), and the impact of training data size on performance.

We introduce HumorReject, a novel data-driven approach that fundamentally reimagines LLM safety by decoupling it from refusal prefixes through the use of humor as an indirect refusal strategy. Rather than explicitly rejecting harmful instructions, HumorReject responds with contextually appropriate humor that naturally defuses potentially dangerous requests while maintaining engaging interactions. Our approach effectively addresses the common "over-defense" issues in existing safety mechanisms, demonstrating superior robustness against various attack vectors while preserving natural and high-quality interactions on legitimate tasks. Our findings suggest that innovations at the data level are even more fundamental than the alignment algorithm itself in achieving effective LLM safety, opening new directions for developing more resilient and user-friendly AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning these models on domain-specific tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model overwrites or loses essential knowledge acquired during pretraining. This phenomenon significantly limits the broader applicability of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compute the element-wise importance of model parameters crucial for preserving general knowledge during fine-tuning. Our method utilizes a dual-objective optimization strategy: (1) regularization loss to retain the parameter crucial for general knowledge; (2) cross-entropy loss to adapt to domain-specific tasks. Additionally, we introduce layer-wise coefficients to account for the varying contributions of different layers, dynamically balancing the dual-objective optimization. Extensive experiments on scientific, medical, and physical tasks using GPT-J and LLaMA-3 demonstrate that our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing model adaptability. Compared to previous methods, our solution is approximately 20 times faster and requires only 10%-15% of the storage, highlighting the practical efficiency. The code will be released.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Judgment of Learning: A Human Ability Beyond Generative Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13392v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mimic human cognition in various language-based tasks. However, their capacity for metacognition - particularly in predicting memory performance - remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a cross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with human judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals predict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs of sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence - a sentence that initially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before requiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting sentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM and human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted actual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy. This discrepancy emerged regardless of whether sentences appeared in fitting or unfitting contexts. These findings indicate that, despite LLMs' demonstrated capacity to model human cognition at the object-level, they struggle at the meta-level, failing to capture the variability in individual memory predictions. By identifying this shortcoming, our study underscores the need for further refinements in LLMs' self-monitoring abilities, which could enhance their utility in educational settings, personalized learning, and human-AI interactions. Strengthening LLMs' metacognitive performance may reduce the reliance on human oversight, paving the way for more autonomous and seamless integration of AI into tasks requiring deeper cognitive awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 2 figures.

However, they incur significant computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens processed, limiting their practicality in resource-constrained environments. We introduce Language-Guided Vision Token Pruning (LVPruning) for MLLMs, an effective yet simple method that significantly reduces the computational burden while preserving model performance. LVPruning employs cross-attention modules to compute the importance of vision tokens based on their interaction with language tokens, determining which to prune. Importantly, LVPruning can be integrated without modifying the original MLLM parameters, which makes LVPruning simple to apply or remove. Our experiments show that LVPruning can effectively reduce up to 90% of vision tokens by the middle layer of LLaVA-1.5, resulting in a 62.1% decrease in inference Tera Floating-Point Operations Per Second (TFLOPs), with an average performance loss of just 0.45% across nine multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of specialized Tabular Question Answering datasets in this domain limits the development of automated question-answering systems. To fill this gap, we introduce RETQA, the first large-scale open-domain Chinese Tabular Question Answering dataset for Real Estate. RETQA comprises 4,932 tables and 20,762 question-answer pairs across 16 sub-fields within three major domains: property information, real estate company finance information and land auction information. Compared with existing tabular question answering datasets, RETQA poses greater challenges due to three key factors: long-table structures, open-domain retrieval, and multi-domain queries. To tackle these challenges, we propose the SLUTQA framework, which integrates large language models with spoken language understanding tasks to enhance retrieval and answering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLUTQA significantly improves the performance of large language models on RETQA by in-context learning. RETQA and SLUTQA provide essential resources for advancing tabular question answering research in the real estate domain, addressing critical challenges in open-domain and long-table question-answering.

The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset. The URSA-8B model, trained on MMathCoT-1M, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similarly sized multimodal LLMs on six popular reasoning benchmarks.

Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data.

A major challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL framework for language models, named Knowledge Identification and Fusion (KIF), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay. KIF initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter dependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a novel group-wise knowledge identification technique to ascertain the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained knowledge fusion strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, KIF achieves an optimal balance between retaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. KIF also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and adaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable extensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay techniques. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two CL benchmarks, involving models ranging from 220M to 7B parameters, affirm the effectiveness of KIF and its variants across different settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version updates the model name from Task Skill Localization and Consolidation (TaSL) to Knowledge Identification and Fusion (KIF).

However, when applied to real-world databases, their performance is significantly less than for these benchmarks, especially for Natural Language (NL) questions requiring complex filters and joins to be processed. This paper then proposes a strategy to compile NL questions into SQL queries that incorporates a dynamic few-shot examples strategy and leverages the services provided by a database keyword search (KwS) platform. The paper details how the precision and recall of the schema-linking process are improved with the help of the examples provided and the keyword-matching service that the KwS platform offers. Then, it shows how the KwS platform can be used to synthesize a view that captures the joins required to process an input NL question and thereby simplify the SQL query compilation step. The paper includes experiments with a real-world relational database to assess the performance of the proposed strategy. The experiments suggest that the strategy achieves an accuracy on the real-world relational database that surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. The paper concludes by discussing the results obtained.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we identify a salient correlation between LFQA faithfulness and retrieval heads, a set of attention heads responsible for retrieving contextual information. Leveraging this insight, we propose RHIO, a framework designed to teach LLMs to explicitly discriminate between faithful and unfaithful generations. RHIO first augments unfaithful samples that simulate realistic model-intrinsic errors by selectively masking retrieval heads. Then, these samples are incorporated into joint training, enabling the model to distinguish unfaithful outputs from faithful ones conditioned on control tokens. Furthermore, these control tokens are leveraged to self-induce contrastive outputs, amplifying their difference through contrastive decoding. Additionally, to facilitate the evaluation of contextual faithfulness, we also introduce GroundBench, a comprehensive benchmark compiled from five existing LFQA datasets. Extensive experimental results on GroundBench demonstrate that RHIO significantly improves faithfulness, even outperforming GPT-4o.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR October 2024</p></details> |

Recent work demonstrates that these API-based agents exhibit relatively strong autonomy and planning capabilities. However, their ability to handle multi-dimensional difficulty levels, diverse task types, and real-world demands remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ShortcutsBench}, a large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of API-based agents in solving real-world complex tasks. \textsc{ShortcutsBench} includes a wealth of real APIs from Apple Inc., refined user queries, human-annotated high-quality action sequences, detailed parameter filling values, and parameters requesting necessary input from the system or user. We revealed how existing benchmarks~/~datasets struggle to accommodate the advanced reasoning capabilities of existing more intelligent LLMs. Moreover, our extensive evaluation of agents built with $5$ leading open-source (size $\geq$ 57B) and $5$ closed-source LLMs (e.g. Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini) with varying intelligence level reveals significant limitations of existing API-based agents in the whole process of handling complex queries related to API selection, parameter filling, and requesting necessary input from the system and the user. These findings highlight the great challenges that API-based agents face in effectively fulfilling real and complex user queries.

| **[CRPO: Confidence-Reward Driven Preference Optimization for Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13927v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language processing tasks, but their application to machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to pretraining on English-centric data and the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both translation accuracy and data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Video Generation with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13918v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs.

Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and data quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for testing how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in the experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the Q-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page: https://gui-bee.github.io</p></details> |  |

Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</p></details> | Full paper, 14 Pages |
| **[Utilizing Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13883v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore a capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with its policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). We also proposed a method to aid the training by first pretraining the model before using the OpenAI-ES to train it further, and tested its effectiveness. The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to obtain high-performing agents. Therefore, the pretraining was shown to be unnecessary; yet still, it helped us observe and formulate several further insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[A space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13830v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imposing additional constraints on low-rank optimization has garnered growing interest. However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The ``space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model driven Policy Exploration for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13816v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Recommender Systems (RS) have incorporated Reinforcement Learning (RL), framing the recommendation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, offline RL policies trained on static user data are vulnerable to distribution shift when deployed in dynamic online environments. Additionally, excessive focus on exploiting short-term relevant items can hinder exploration, leading to suboptimal recommendations and negatively impacting long-term user gains. Online RL-based RS also face challenges in production deployment, due to the risks of exposing users to untrained or unstable policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to mimic user objectives and preferences for pre-training policies offline to enhance the initial recommendations in online settings. Effectively managing distribution shift and balancing exploration are crucial for improving RL-based RS, especially when leveraging LLM-based pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose an Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP) that utilizes user preferences distilled from an LLM. Our approach involves prompting the LLM with user states to extract item preferences, learning rewards based on feedback, and updating the RL policy using an actor-critic framework. Furthermore, to deploy iALP in an online scenario, we introduce an adaptive variant, A-iALP, that implements a simple fine-tuning strategy (A-iALP$_{ft}$), and an adaptive approach (A-iALP$_{ap}$) designed to mitigate issues with compromised policies and limited exploration. Experiments across three simulated environments demonstrate that A-iALP introduces substantial performance improvements</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Causality with Neurochaos Learning: Proposed Approach and Research Agenda](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13763v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning implemented via neural networks, has revolutionized machine learning by providing methods for complex tasks such as object detection/classification and prediction. However, architectures based on deep neural networks have started to yield diminishing returns, primarily due to their statistical nature and inability to capture causal structure in the training data. Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption, which is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective. Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these issues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One approach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items in the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this will help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned representations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos Learning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear chaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks (brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results over just deep learning alone. To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos learning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results, especially in domains that contain linked data. We propose an approach for this integration to enhance classification, prediction and reinforcement learning. We also propose a set of research questions that need to be investigated in order to make this integration a reality.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Combining Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Reinforcement Learning for TinyML](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14109v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on microcontrollers (TinyML) is a common trend to process the increasing amount of sensor data generated at the edge, but in practice, resource and latency constraints make it difficult to find optimal DNN candidates. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an excellent approach to automate this search and can easily be combined with DNN compression techniques commonly used in TinyML. However, many NAS techniques are not only computationally expensive, especially hyperparameter optimization (HPO), but also often focus on optimizing only a single objective, e.g., maximizing accuracy, without considering additional objectives such as memory requirements or computational complexity of a DNN, which are key to making deployment at the edge feasible. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS strategy for TinyML based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBOpt) and an ensemble of competing parametric policies trained using Augmented Random Search (ARS) reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our methodology aims at efficiently finding tradeoffs between a DNN's predictive accuracy, memory requirements on a given target system, and computational complexity. Our experiments show that we consistently outperform existing MOBOpt approaches on different datasets and architectures such as ResNet-18 and MobileNetV3.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization, 14 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic for Live Stream Allocation in Feed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10381v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement, thus improving dwelling time and improving user retention. In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to inject at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream injection policy for accurate live stream allocation. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, and these issues may cause too many live stream allocations, which interrupts the user's short-video interest and leads to a decrease in the user's app usage duration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live-stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13727v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety and scalability are two critical challenges faced by practical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms that rely solely on reward shaping are ineffective in ensuring safety, and their scalability is rather limited due to the fixed-size network output. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Scalable Safe MARL (SS-MARL), to enhance the safety and scalability of MARL methods. Leveraging the inherent graph structure of MAS, we design a multi-layer message passing network to aggregate local observations and communications of varying sizes. Furthermore, we develop a constrained joint policy optimization method in the setting of local observation to improve safety. Simulation experiments demonstrate that SS-MARL achieves a better trade-off between optimality and safety compared to baselines, and its scalability significantly outperforms the latest methods in scenarios with a large number of agents. The feasibility of our method is also verified by hardware implementation with Mecanum-wheeled vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Language Models: A Blueprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11223v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-V3, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining Reinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.</p></details> |  |

However, despite its potential, traditional PbRL methods are often constrained by the indistinguishability of segments, which impedes the learning process. In this paper, we introduce Skill-Enhanced Preference Optimization Algorithm (S-EPOA), which addresses the segment indistinguishability issue by integrating skill mechanisms into the preference learning framework. Specifically, we first conduct the unsupervised pretraining to learn useful skills. Then, we propose a novel query selection mechanism to balance the information gain and distinguishability over the learned skill space. Experimental results on a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion, demonstrate that S-EPOA significantly outperforms conventional PbRL methods in terms of both robustness and learning efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of skill-driven learning in overcoming the challenges posed by segment indistinguishability.</p></details> | Under review |

However, recent studies in reward modeling schemes are skewed towards English, limiting the applicability of RLHF in multilingual alignments. In this work, we investigate the cross-lingual transfer of RMs trained in diverse languages, primarily from English. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong cross-lingual transfer of English RMs, exceeding target language RMs by 3~4% average increase in Multilingual RewardBench. Furthermore, we analyze the cross-lingual transfer of RMs through the representation shifts. Finally, we perform multilingual alignment to exemplify how cross-lingual transfer in RM propagates to enhanced multilingual instruction-following capability, along with extensive analyses on off-the-shelf RMs. We release the code, model, and data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Recently, model-free and multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches have been used to address this challenge. In this article, we introduce WFCRL (Wind Farm Control with Reinforcement Learning), the first open suite of multi-agent reinforcement learning environments for the wind farm control problem. WFCRL frames a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem: each turbine is an agent and can learn to adjust its yaw, pitch or torque to maximize the common objective (e.g. the total power production of the farm). WFCRL also offers turbine load observations that will allow to optimize the farm performance while limiting turbine structural damages. Interfaces with two state-of-the-art farm simulators are implemented in WFCRL: a static simulator (FLORIS) and a dynamic simulator (FAST.Farm). For each simulator, $10$ wind layouts are provided, including $5$ real wind farms. Two state-of-the-art online MARL algorithms are implemented to illustrate the scaling challenges. As learning online on FAST.Farm is highly time-consuming, WFCRL offers the possibility of designing transfer learning strategies from FLORIS to FAST.Farm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline and Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16764v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proved to have a promising role in future intelligent wireless networks. Online RL has been adopted for radio resource management (RRM), taking over traditional schemes. However, due to its reliance on online interaction with the environment, its role becomes limited in practical, real-world problems where online interaction is not feasible. In addition, traditional RL stands short in front of the uncertainties and risks in real-world stochastic environments. In this manner, we propose an offline and distributional RL scheme for the RRM problem, enabling offline training using a static dataset without any interaction with the environment and considering the sources of uncertainties using the distributions of the return. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional resource management models. In addition, it is the only scheme that surpasses online RL with a 10 % gain over online RL.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of explainability in complex deep learning (DL) models poses a challenge for practical implementation. This paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI)- based framework for feature selection and model complexity reduction in a model-agnostic manner. Applied to a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) setting, our approach addresses the joint sub-band assignment and power allocation problem in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We propose a novel two-stage systematic explainability framework leveraging feature relevance-oriented XAI to simplify the DRL agents. While the former stage generates a state feature importance ranking of the trained models using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based importance scores, the latter stage exploits these importance-based rankings to simplify the state space of the agents by removing the least important features from the model input. Simulation results demonstrate that the XAI-assisted methodology achieves 97% of the original MADRL sum-rate performance while reducing optimal state features by 28%, average training time by 11%, and trainable weight parameters by 46% in a network with eight vehicular pairs.</p></details> |  |

This is a key challenge in applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to reinforcement learning, where the PoM not only helps with finding an optimal action, but yields a fine-grained analysis of the action domain, crucial in tasks such as drug discovery. Existing techniques are costly, scaling polynomially in computation and memory with the vector size. We introduce LITE, the first approach for estimating Gaussian PoM with almost-linear time and memory complexity. LITE achieves SOTA accuracy on a number of tasks, while being in practice several orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. This also translates to a better performance on downstream tasks such as entropy estimation and optimal control of bandits. Theoretically, we cast LITE as entropy-regularized UCB and connect it to prior PoM estimators.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Taking as use case the problem of efficiently counting paths and cycles in graphs, a key challenge in network analysis, computer science, biology, and social sciences, GRL discovers new matrix-based formulas for path/cycle counting that improve computational efficiency by factors of two to six w.r.t state-of-the-art approaches. Our contributions include: (i) a framework for generating gramformers that operate within a CFG, (ii) the development of GRL for optimizing formulas within grammatical structures, and (iii) the discovery of novel formulas for graph substructure counting, leading to significant computational improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return-Aligned Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03923v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches in offline reinforcement learning aim to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, also known as return. It is increasingly important to adjust the performance of AI agents to meet human requirements, for example, in applications like video games and education tools. Decision Transformer (DT) optimizes a policy that generates actions conditioned on the target return through supervised learning and includes a mechanism to control the agent's performance using the target return. However, the action generation is hardly influenced by the target return because DT's self-attention allocates scarce attention scores to the return tokens. In this paper, we propose Return-Aligned Decision Transformer (RADT), designed to more effectively align the actual return with the target return. RADT leverages features extracted by paying attention solely to the return, enabling action generation to consistently depend on the target return. Extensive experiments show that RADT significantly reduces the discrepancies between the actual return and the target return compared to DT-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Large Reasoning Models: A Survey of Reinforced Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09686v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning. The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of "thought" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to "think" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 36 pages, 5 figures |

BMG-Q advances ride-pooling decision-making process with the localized bipartite match graph underlying the Markov Decision Process, enabling the development of novel Graph Attention Double Deep Q Network (GATDDQN) as the MARL backbone to capture the dynamic interactions among ride-pooling vehicles in fleet. Our approach enriches the state information for each agent with GATDDQN by leveraging a localized bipartite interdependence graph and enables a centralized global coordinator to optimize order matching and agent behavior using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Enhanced by gradient clipping and localized graph sampling, our GATDDQN improves scalability and robustness. Furthermore, the inclusion of a posterior score function in the ILP captures the online exploration-exploitation trade-off and reduces the potential overestimation bias of agents, thereby elevating the quality of the derived solutions. Through extensive experiments and validation, BMG-Q has demonstrated superior performance in both training and operations for thousands of vehicle agents, outperforming benchmark reinforcement learning frameworks by around 10% in accumulative rewards and showing a significant reduction in overestimation bias by over 50%. Additionally, it maintains robustness amidst task variations and fleet size changes, establishing BMG-Q as an effective, scalable, and robust framework for advancing ride-pooling order dispatch operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20487v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experience replay is widely used to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by leveraging past experiences. However, existing experience replay methods, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, often suffer from low efficiency, particularly in real-world scenarios with high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach, Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay (EDER). EDER employs a deterministic point process to model the diversity between samples and prioritizes replay based on the diversity between samples. To further enhance learning efficiency, we incorporate Cholesky decomposition for handling large state spaces in realistic environments. Additionally, rejection sampling is applied to select samples with higher diversity, thereby improving overall learning efficacy. Extensive experiments are conducted on robotic manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic indoor environments in Habitat. The results demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also achieves superior performance in high-dimensional, realistic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concurrent Learning with Aggregated States via Randomized Least Squares Value Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13394v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaWM: Adaptive World Model based Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13072v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

We propose a novel architecture for recommending which LLM agent out of many should perform a task given a natural language prompt by extending the Sentence-BERT (SBERT) encoder model. On test data, we are able to achieve a top-1 accuracy of 92.2% with each classification taking less than 300 milliseconds. In contrast to traditional classification methods, our architecture is computationally cheap, adaptive to new classes, interpretable, and controllable with arbitrary metrics through reinforcement learning. By encoding natural language prompts into sentence embeddings, our model captures the semantic content relevant to recommending an agent. The distance between sentence embeddings that belong to the same agent is then minimized through fine-tuning and aligned to human values through reinforcement learning from human feedback. This allows the classification of natural language prompts based on their nearest neighbors by measuring the cosine similarity between embeddings. This work is made possible through the generation of a synthetic dataset for agent recommendation, which we have open-sourced to the public along with the code for AgentRec recommendation system at https://github.com/joshprk/agentrec.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, preprint</p></details> |

However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to generative models to align them with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using Preference Optimization (PO) to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks, commonly seen in contrastive models like CLIP. We further apply our method to disentangle gender understanding and mitigate gender biases, offering a more nuanced control over these sensitive attributes. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method on several vision-language tasks, tackling challenges such as typographic attacks. Additionally, we explore the model's ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG and establishing automated benchmarking pipelines remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a dataset designed to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics for assessing generation quality and develop an automated annotation pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to generate outputs across diverse RAG scenarios. GPT-4o is used to evaluate and construct preference data. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results show that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a held-out test set, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our approach and the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility of using RLHF to enhance RAG pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

It combines topic modeling, expert input, and reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed approach has three key steps: (1) generate aspect-based topic models using expert-weighted keywords to emphasize critical aspects, (2) analyze similarities and entropy changes by comparing topic distributions across iterative models, and (3) refine topic selection using reinforcement learning (RL) with a modified reward function that integrates changes in topic divergence and similarity across iterations. The method is tested on quantum communication documents with a focus on advances in cryptography and security protocols.

This satisficing behaviour is necessary for robotic manipulation where random exploration can be costly due to catastrophic failures and time. O2O RL is especially compelling when we can only obtain a scarce amount of (potentially suboptimal) demonstrations$\unicode{x2014}$a scenario where behavioural cloning (BC) is known to suffer from distribution shift. Previous works have outlined the challenges in applying O2O RL algorithms under the image-based environments. In this work, we propose a novel O2O RL algorithm that can learn in a real-life image-based robotic vacuum grasping task with a small number of demonstrations where BC fails majority of the time. The proposed algorithm replaces the target network in off-policy actor-critic algorithms with a regularization technique inspired by neural tangent kernel. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reach above 90\% success rate in under two hours of interaction time, with only 50 human demonstrations, while BC and existing commonly-used RL algorithms fail to achieve similar performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Co...</summary><p>In CoRL Workshop on Mastering Robot Manipulation in a World of Abundant Data 2024</p></details> |
| **[State Combinatorial Generalization In Decision Making With Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13241v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world decision-making problems are combinatorial in nature, where states (e.g., surrounding traffic of a self-driving car) can be seen as a combination of basic elements (e.g., pedestrians, trees, and other cars). Due to combinatorial complexity, observing all combinations of basic elements in the training set is infeasible, which leads to an essential yet understudied problem of zero-shot generalization to states that are unseen combinations of previously seen elements. In this work, we first formalize this problem and then demonstrate how existing value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle due to unreliable value predictions in unseen states. We argue that this problem cannot be addressed with exploration alone, but requires more expressive and generalizable models. We demonstrate that behavior cloning with a conditioned diffusion model trained on expert trajectory generalizes better to states formed by new combinations of seen elements than traditional RL methods. Through experiments in maze, driving, and multiagent environments, we show that conditioned diffusion models outperform traditional RL techniques and highlight the broad applicability of our problem formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRMT: Shared Memory for Multi-agent Lifelong Pathfinding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13200v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demonstrates significant progress in solving cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments. One of the principal challenges in MARL is the need for explicit prediction of the agents' behavior to achieve cooperation. To resolve this issue, we propose the Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) which extends memory transformers to multi-agent settings by pooling and globally broadcasting individual working memories, enabling agents to exchange information implicitly and coordinate their actions. We evaluate SRMT on the Partially Observable Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem in a toy Bottleneck navigation task that requires agents to pass through a narrow corridor and on a POGEMA benchmark set of tasks. In the Bottleneck task, SRMT consistently outperforms a variety of reinforcement learning baselines, especially under sparse rewards, and generalizes effectively to longer corridors than those seen during training. On POGEMA maps, including Mazes, Random, and MovingAI, SRMT is competitive with recent MARL, hybrid, and planning-based algorithms. These results suggest that incorporating shared recurrent memory into the transformer-based architectures can enhance coordination in decentralized multi-agent systems. The source code for training and evaluation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Aloriosa/srmt.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Which Sensor to Observe? Timely Tracking of a Joint Markov Source with Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13099v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of remote estimation of a discrete-time joint Markov process using multiple sensors. Each sensor observes a different component of the joint Markov process, and in each time slot, the monitor obtains a partial state value by sending a pull request to one of the sensors. The monitor chooses the sequence of sensors to observe with the goal of minimizing the mean of age of incorrect information (MAoII) by using the partial state observations obtained, which have different freshness levels. For instance, a monitor may be interested in tracking the location of an object by obtaining observations from two sensors, which observe the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the object separately, in different time slots. The monitor, then, needs to decide which coordinate to observe in the next time slot given the history. In addition to this partial observability of the state of Markov process, there is an erasure channel with a fixed one-slot delay between each sensor and the monitor. First, we obtain a sufficient statistic, namely the \emph{belief}, representing the joint distribution of the age of incorrect information (AoII) and the current state of the observed process by using the history of all pull requests and observations. Then, we formulate the problem with a continuous state-space Markov decision problem (MDP), namely belief MDP. To solve the problem, we propose two model predictive control (MPC) methods, namely MPC without terminal costs (MPC-WTC) and reinforcement learning MPC (RL-MPC), that have different advantages in implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-Driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Particle Filtering for Source Localization in Dynamic Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13084v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, such as gas leak detection or environmental pollutant tracking, solving the Inverse Source Localization and Characterization problem involves navigating complex, dynamic fields with sparse and noisy observations. Traditional methods face significant challenges, including partial observability, temporal and spatial dynamics, out-of-distribution generalization, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning. The framework leverages an attention-enhanced particle filtering mechanism for efficient and accurate belief updates, and incorporates two complementary execution strategies: Attention Particle Filtering Planning and Attention Particle Filtering Reinforcement Learning. These approaches optimize exploration and adaptation under uncertainty. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of the attention-enhanced particle filter, while extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the framework's superior accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the framework's potential for broad applications in dynamic field estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution and The Knightian Blindspot of Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13075v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper claims that machine learning (ML) largely overlooks an important facet of general intelligence: robustness to a qualitatively unknown future in an open world. Such robustness relates to Knightian uncertainty (KU) in economics, i.e. uncertainty that cannot be quantified, which is excluded from consideration in ML's key formalisms. This paper aims to identify this blind spot, argue its importance, and catalyze research into addressing it, which we believe is necessary to create truly robust open-world AI. To help illuminate the blind spot, we contrast one area of ML, reinforcement learning (RL), with the process of biological evolution. Despite staggering ongoing progress, RL still struggles in open-world situations, often failing under unforeseen situations. For example, the idea of zero-shot transferring a self-driving car policy trained only in the US to the UK currently seems exceedingly ambitious. In dramatic contrast, biological evolution routinely produces agents that thrive within an open world, sometimes even to situations that are remarkably out-of-distribution (e.g. invasive species; or humans, who do undertake such zero-shot international driving). Interestingly, evolution achieves such robustness without explicit theory, formalisms, or mathematical gradients. We explore the assumptions underlying RL's typical formalisms, showing how they limit RL's engagement with the unknown unknowns characteristic of an ever-changing complex world. Further, we identify mechanisms through which evolutionary processes foster robustness to novel and unpredictable challenges, and discuss potential pathways to algorithmically embody them. The conclusion is that the intriguing remaining fragility of ML may result from blind spots in its formalisms, and that significant gains may result from direct confrontation with the challenge of KU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Return Distributions with Distributional Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13028v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond expected utilities, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained so far (since the first time step). We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we combine the core ideas of distributional value iteration with the deep RL agent DQN, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.</p></details> |  |

We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an offline MARL algorithm for radio resource management (RRM), focusing on optimizing scheduling policies for multiple access points (APs) to jointly maximize the sum and tail rates of user equipment (UEs). We evaluate three training paradigms: centralized, independent, and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline MARL framework outperforms conventional baseline approaches, achieving over a 15\% improvement in a weighted combination of sum and tail rates. Additionally, the CTDE framework strikes an effective balance, reducing the computational complexity of centralized methods while addressing the inefficiencies of independent training. These results underscore the potential of offline MARL to deliver scalable, robust, and efficient solutions for resource management in dynamic wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

Existing work attempts to address this issue by data augmentation with the learned policy or adding extra constraints with the value-based RL algorithm. However, these studies still fail to overcome the following challenges: (1) insufficiently utilizing the historical temporal information among inter-steps, (2) overlooking the local intrastep relationships among return-to-gos (RTGs), states, and actions, (3) overfitting suboptimal trajectories with noisy labels. To address these challenges, we propose Decision Mamba (DM), a novel multi-grained state space model (SSM) with a self-evolving policy learning strategy. DM explicitly models the historical hidden state to extract the temporal information by using the mamba architecture. To capture the relationship among RTG-state-action triplets, a fine-grained SSM module is designed and integrated into the original coarse-grained SSM in mamba, resulting in a novel mamba architecture tailored for offline RL. Finally, to mitigate the overfitting issue on noisy trajectories, a self-evolving policy is proposed by using progressive regularization. The policy evolves by using its own past knowledge to refine the suboptimal actions, thus enhancing its robustness on noisy demonstrations. Extensive experiments on various tasks show that DM outperforms other baselines substantially.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024; Code is available at https://github.com/aopolin-lv/DecisionMamba</p></details> |

In these scenarios, schedulers must make real-time decisions to satisfy both delay and resource constraints without prior knowledge of system dynamics, which are often time-varying and challenging to estimate. Current learning-based methods typically require interactions with actual systems during the training stage, which can be difficult or impractical, as it is capable of significantly degrading system performance and incurring substantial service costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel offline reinforcement learning-based algorithm, named \underline{S}cheduling By \underline{O}ffline Learning with \underline{C}ritic Guidance and \underline{D}iffusion Generation (SOCD), to learn efficient scheduling policies purely from pre-collected \emph{offline data}. SOCD innovatively employs a diffusion-based policy network, complemented by a sampling-free critic network for policy guidance. By integrating the Lagrangian multiplier optimization into the offline reinforcement learning, SOCD effectively trains high-quality constraint-aware policies exclusively from available datasets, eliminating the need for online interactions with the system. Experimental results demonstrate that SOCD is resilient to various system dynamics, including partially observable and large-scale environments, and delivers superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Numerous enhancements to the fundamental DE have been proposed, incorporating innovative mutation strategies and sophisticated parameter tuning techniques to improve performance. However, no single variant has proven universally superior across all problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design DE for black-box optimization through meta-learning. RL acts as an advanced meta-optimizer, generating a customized DE configuration that includes an optimal initialization strategy, update rule, and hyperparameters tailored to a specific black-box optimization problem. This process is informed by a detailed analysis of the problem characteristics. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize a double deep Q-network for implementation, considering a subset of 40 possible strategy combinations and parameter optimizations simultaneously. The framework's performance is evaluated against black-box optimization benchmarks and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Context-based approaches utilize a history of state-action-reward transitions -- referred to as the context -- to infer representations of the current task, and then condition the agent, i.e., the policy and value function, on the task representations. Intuitively, the better the task representations capture the underlying tasks, the better the agent can generalize to new tasks. Unfortunately, context-based approaches suffer from distribution mismatch, as the context in the offline data does not match the context at test time, limiting their ability to generalize to the test tasks. This leads to the task representations overfitting to the offline training data. Intuitively, the task representations should be independent of the behavior policy used to collect the offline data. To address this issue, we approximately minimize the mutual information between the distribution over the task representations and behavior policy by maximizing the entropy of behavior policy conditioned on the task representations. We validate our approach in MuJoCo environments, showing that compared to baselines, our task representations more faithfully represent the underlying tasks, leading to outperforming prior methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, obtaining real-world crop state measurements is labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. In most cases, it is not feasible to gather crop state measurements before every decision moment. Moreover, in previous research pertaining to farm management optimization, these observations are often assumed to be readily available without any cost, which is unrealistic. Hence, enabling optimization without the need to have temporally complete crop state observations is important. An approach to that problem is to include measuring as part of decision making. As a solution, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to recommend opportune moments to simultaneously measure crop features and apply nitrogen fertilizer. With realistic considerations, we design an RL environment with explicit crop feature measuring costs. While balancing costs, we find that an RL agent, trained with recurrent PPO, discovers adaptive measuring policies that follow critical crop development stages, with results aligned by what domain experts would consider a sensible approach. Our results highlight the importance of measuring when crop feature measurements are not readily available.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, accepted after peer-review at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI for Social Impact Track, February 2025, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</p></details> |

However, existing platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which makes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from managing their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and the heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive near-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper, we investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for serverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending requests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose two online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating several important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive simulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing with an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms efficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our decision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE ICC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Sequential Decision-Making in Geosteering: A Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04772v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory adjustment decisions throughout the drilling process, called geosteering, affect subsequent choices and information gathering, thus resulting in a coupled sequential decision problem. Previous works on applying decision optimization methods in geosteering rely on greedy optimization or approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Either decision optimization method requires explicit uncertainty and objective function models, making developing decision optimization methods for complex and realistic geosteering environments challenging to impossible. We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) method, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method that learns directly from the decision environment, to optimize geosteering decisions. The expensive computations for RL are handled during the offline training stage. Evaluating DQN needed for real-time decision support takes milliseconds and is faster than the traditional alternatives. Moreover, for two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, our results show that RL achieves high-quality outcomes comparable to the quasi-optimal ADP. Yet, the model-free nature of RL means that by replacing the training environment, we can extend it to problems where the solution to ADP is prohibitively expensive to compute. This flexibility will allow applying it to more complex environments and make hybrid versions trained with real data in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Preference Alignment for Language Models via Count-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12735v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown great potential in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human preferences. Existing methods perform preference alignment from a fixed dataset, which can be limited in data coverage, and the resulting reward model is hard to generalize in out-of-distribution responses. Thus, online RLHF is more desirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial dataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e. \emph{how to explore} for LLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that an optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a provably efficient RLHF policy. Then, we reformulate our objective to direct preference optimization with an exploration term, where the UCB-term can be converted to a count-based exploration bonus. We further propose a practical algorithm, named \emph{Count-based Online Preference Optimization (COPO)}, which leverages a simple coin-flip counting module to estimate the pseudo-count of a prompt-response pair in previously collected data. COPO encourages LLMs to balance exploration and preference optimization in an iterative manner, which enlarges the exploration space and the entire data coverage of iterative LLM policies. We conduct online RLHF experiments on Zephyr and Llama-3 models. The results on instruction-following and standard academic benchmarks show that COPO significantly increases performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
