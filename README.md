| **[FactCG: Enhancing Fact Checkers with Graph-Based Multi-Hop Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17144v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior research on training grounded factuality classification models to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) has relied on public natural language inference (NLI) data and synthetic data. However, conventional NLI datasets are not well-suited for document-level reasoning, which is critical for detecting LLM hallucinations. Recent approaches to document-level synthetic data generation involve iteratively removing sentences from documents and annotating factuality using LLM-based prompts. While effective, this method is computationally expensive for long documents and limited by the LLM's capabilities. In this work, we analyze the differences between existing synthetic training data used in state-of-the-art models and real LLM output claims. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach for synthetic data generation, CG2C, that leverages multi-hop reasoning on context graphs extracted from documents. Our fact checker model, FactCG, demonstrates improved performance with more connected reasoning, using the same backbone models. Experiments show it even outperforms GPT-4-o on the LLM-Aggrefact benchmark with much smaller model size.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[Abstract Operations Research Modeling Using Natural Language Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07272v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations research (OR) uses mathematical models to enhance decision-making, but developing these models requires expert knowledge and can be time-consuming. Automated mathematical programming (AMP) has emerged to simplify this process, but existing systems have limitations. This paper introduces a novel methodology that uses recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) to create and edit OR solutions from non-expert user queries expressed using Natural Language. This reduces the need for domain expertise and the time to formulate a problem. The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline, named NL2OR, that generates solutions to OR problems from natural language input, and shares experimental results on several important OR problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRAL: Automated Safety Testing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17132v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content. However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coupling without Communication and Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07978v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to draw a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $\Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem \emph{without communicating at all?} Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $\Pr[a = b] \geq \frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$ using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. This bound was shown to be optimal in the worst-case by [Bavarian et al., 2020]. In this work, we revisit the communication-free coupling problem. We provide a simpler proof of the optimality result from [Bavarian et al., 2020]. We show that, while the worst-case success probability of Weighted MinHash cannot be improved, an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling offers a Pareto improvement: for every pair of distributions $P, Q$, Gumbel sampling achieves an equal or higher value of $\Pr[a = b]$ than Weighted MinHash. Importantly, this improvement translates to practice. We demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to \emph{speculative decoding}, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols can be used to contruct \emph{\CSD{}} schemes, which have the desirable property that their output is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation. In experiments on a language generation task, Gumbel sampling outperforms Weighted MinHash. Code is available at https://github.com/majid-daliri/DISD.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17116v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-reflecting Large Language Models: A Hegelian Dialectical Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14917v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the Hegelian Dialectic for LLMs' self-reflection, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the contradicting points. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed temperature strategy for generation. Our proposed approach is examined to determine its ability to generate novel ideas from an initial proposition. Additionally, a Multi Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy is leveraged to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves beneficial in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments show promise in generating new ideas and provide a stepping stone for future research.</p></details> |  |

| **[SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |
| **[Evidence on the Regularisation Properties of Maximum-Entropy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17115v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalisation and robustness properties of policies learnt through Maximum-Entropy Reinforcement Learning are investigated on chaotic dynamical systems with Gaussian noise on the observable. First, the robustness under noise contamination of the agent's observation of entropy regularised policies is observed. Second, notions of statistical learning theory, such as complexity measures on the learnt model, are borrowed to explain and predict the phenomenon. Results show the existence of a relationship between entropy-regularised policy optimisation and robustness to noise, which can be described by the chosen complexity measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Transparent Alignment Through Enhanced Inverse Constitutional AI for Principle Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17112v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on implicit principles, limiting interpretability. Constitutional AI (CAI) offers an explicit, rule-based framework for guiding model outputs. Building on this, we refine the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) algorithm, which extracts constitutions from preference datasets. By improving principle generation, clustering, and embedding processes, our approach enhances the accuracy and generalizability of extracted principles across synthetic and real-world datasets. While in-context alignment yields modest improvements, our results highlight the potential of these principles to foster more transparent and adaptable alignment methods, offering a promising direction for future advancements beyond traditional fine-tuning.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |
| **[COS(M+O)S: Curiosity and RL-Enhanced MCTS for Exploring Story Space via Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17104v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present COS(M+O)S, a System 2-inspired framework for open-ended plot development that systematically explores the vast space of possible story expansions, enabling a 3B-parameter language model to approach the plot quality of a 70B model on select short-story tasks. The method accomplishes this by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by a step-level value model that rewards moderate surprisal (curiosity) while penalizing incoherence, and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to fine-tune the policy on high-value plot expansions. This iterative reinforcement learning loop systematically explores multiple candidate plot branches, backpropagates quality signals, and adapts the policy for faster convergence, notably shifting the policy from puzzle-based Chain-of-Thought to more character-driven storytelling. In small-scale tests with short-story prompts, 67%-77% of participants favored COS(M+O)S's highest-rated expansions over lower-rated ones, suggesting that our learned value function aligns. GPT-4o ratings further show that COS(M+O)S surpasses naive single-pass decoding from Llama 3.2 3B by 0.59 SD, coming within 0.06 SD of Llama 3.1 70B (no significant difference, p=0.93). Pairwise comparisons with o1 place COS(M+O)S 1.5 SD above the 3B baseline and find no statistically significant gap from 70B. Nevertheless, absolute story quality remains modest, constrained by the small model's capacity and limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Mean Field Control on Sparse Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17079v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large agent networks are abundant in applications and nature and pose difficult challenges in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to their computational and theoretical complexity. While graphon mean field games and their extensions provide efficient learning algorithms for dense and moderately sparse agent networks, the case of realistic sparser graphs remains largely unsolved. Thus, we propose a novel mean field control model inspired by local weak convergence to include sparse graphs such as power law networks with coefficients above two. Besides a theoretical analysis, we design scalable learning algorithms which apply to the challenging class of graph sequences with finite first moment. We compare our model and algorithms for various examples on synthetic and real world networks with mean field algorithms based on Lp graphons and graphexes. As it turns out, our approach outperforms existing methods in many examples and on various networks due to the special design aiming at an important, but so far hard to solve class of MARL problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Induced Modularity and Community Detection for Functionally Interpretable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17077v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability in reinforcement learning is crucial for ensuring AI systems align with human values and fulfill the diverse related requirements including safety, robustness and fairness. Building on recent approaches to encouraging sparsity and locality in neural networks, we demonstrate how the penalisation of non-local weights leads to the emergence of functionally independent modules in the policy network of a reinforcement learning agent. To illustrate this, we demonstrate the emergence of two parallel modules for assessment of movement along the X and Y axes in a stochastic Minigrid environment. Through the novel application of community detection algorithms, we show how these modules can be automatically identified and their functional roles verified through direct intervention on the network weights prior to inference. This establishes a scalable framework for reinforcement learning interpretability through functional modularity, addressing challenges regarding the trade-off between completeness and cognitive tractability of reinforcement learning explanations.</p></details> |  |
