Here, we explore their potential for decomposing latent representations in complex and high-dimensional biological data, where the underlying variables are often unknown. Using simulated data, we find that latent representations can encode observable and directly connected upstream hidden variables in superposition. The degree to which they are learned depends on the type of variable and the model architecture, favoring shallow and wide networks. Superpositions, however, are not identifiable if the generative variables are unknown. SAEs can recover these variables and their structure with respect to the observables. Applied to single-cell multi-omics data, we show that SAEs can uncover key biological processes. We further present an automated method for linking SAE features to biological concepts to enable large-scale analysis of single-cell expression models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: employing top-of-the-line models often requires paying thousands of dollars for API calls, while the resulting datasets are static and challenging to audit. To address these challenges, we propose a simple alternative: rather than directly querying labels from pretrained models, we task models to generate programs that can produce labels. These programs can be stored and applied locally, re-used and extended, and cost orders of magnitude less. Our system, Alchemist, obtains comparable to or better performance than large language model-based annotation in a range of tasks for a fraction of the cost: on average, improvements amount to a 12.9% enhancement while the total labeling costs across all datasets are reduced by a factor of approximately 500x.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight Paper</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[STOP! Benchmarking Large Language Models with Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13843v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[SELMA: A Speech-Enabled Language Model for Virtual Assistant Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19377v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Trust-Oriented Adaptive Guardrails for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08959v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Large Language Models are Advanced Anonymizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13846v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent privacy research on large language models (LLMs) has shown that they achieve near-human-level performance at inferring personal data from online texts. With ever-increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. In this work, we take two steps to bridge this gap: First, we present a new setting for evaluating anonymization in the face of adversarial LLM inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers. Our evaluation shows that adversarial anonymization outperforms current commercial anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy. We support our findings with a human study (n=50) highlighting a strong and consistent human preference for LLM-anonymized texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Up Membership Inference: When and How Attacks Succeed on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00154v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIA) attempt to verify the membership of a given data sample in the training set for a model. MIA has become relevant in recent years, following the rapid development of large language models (LLM). Many are concerned about the usage of copyrighted materials for training them and call for methods for detecting such usage. However, recent research has largely concluded that current MIA methods do not work on LLMs. Even when they seem to work, it is usually because of the ill-designed experimental setup where other shortcut features enable "cheating." In this work, we argue that MIA still works on LLMs, but only when multiple documents are presented for testing. We construct new benchmarks that measure the MIA performances at a continuous scale of data samples, from sentences (n-grams) to a collection of documents (multiple chunks of tokens). To validate the efficacy of current MIA approaches at greater scales, we adapt a recent work on Dataset Inference (DI) for the task of binary membership detection that aggregates paragraph-level MIA features to enable MIA at document and collection of documents level. This baseline achieves the first successful MIA on pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2025.

While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Prompt Personalization for Recommendation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17115v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective prompts can empower LLMs to understand user preferences and provide recommendations with intent comprehension and knowledge utilization capabilities. Nevertheless, recent studies predominantly concentrate on task-wise prompting, developing fixed prompt templates shared across all users in a given recommendation task (e.g., rating or ranking). Although convenient, task-wise prompting overlooks individual user differences, leading to inaccurate analysis of user interests. In this work, we introduce the concept of instance-wise prompting, aiming at personalizing discrete prompts for individual users. Toward this end, we propose Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) to realize it automatically. To improve efficiency and quality, RPP personalizes prompts at the sentence level rather than searching in the vast vocabulary word-by-word. Specifically, RPP breaks down the prompt into four patterns, tailoring patterns based on multi-agent and combining them. Then the personalized prompts interact with LLMs (environment) iteratively, to boost LLMs' recommending performance (reward). In addition to RPP, to improve the scalability of action space, our proposal of RPP+ dynamically refines the selected actions with LLMs throughout the iterative process. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of RPP/RPP+ over traditional recommender models, few-shot methods, and other prompt-based methods, underscoring the significance of instance-wise prompting in LLMs for recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/maowenyu-11/RPP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Exploration of Large Language Models by Optimal Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08925v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is a crucial skill for self-improvement and open-ended problem-solving. However, it remains unclear if large language models can effectively explore the state-space within an unknown environment. This work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking the agent with delivering information that enhances future returns. Within this framework, we argue that measuring agent returns is not sufficient for a fair evaluation and decompose missing rewards into exploration and exploitation components based on the optimal achievable return. Comprehensive experiments with various models reveal that most struggle to sufficiently explore the state-space and weak exploration is insufficient. We observe a positive correlation between parameter count and exploration performance, with larger models demonstrating superior capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our decomposition provides insights into differences in behaviors driven by prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining performance in exploratory tasks.</p></details> |  |

Button: Improving Understanding in Educational Videos with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14201v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a simple way to use large language models (LLMs) in education. Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 18th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Technologies for E-Learning (MTEL), 2024</p></details> |
| **[COMPL-AI Framework: A Technical Interpretation and LLM Benchmarking Suite for the EU Artificial Intelligence Act](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07959v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Robustness of Representation Misdirection for Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19202v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation Misdirection (RM) and variants are established large language model (LLM) unlearning methods with state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we show that RM methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in RM models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation -- a model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of RM methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of RM models while enhancing the unlearning performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main, long paper</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Knowledge Minigraph Agents for Literature Review Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06159v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Literature reviews play a crucial role in scientific research for understanding the current state of research, identifying gaps, and guiding future studies on specific topics. However, the process of conducting a comprehensive literature review is yet time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework, collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs), to automate scholarly literature reviews. A novel prompt-based algorithm, the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), is designed to identify relations between concepts from academic literature and automatically constructs knowledge minigraphs. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models on constructed knowledge minigraphs, the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) efficiently organizes concepts and relations from different viewpoints to generate literature review paragraphs. We evaluate CKMAs on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, further revealing promising applications of LLMs in scientific research.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a multi-modal agent tuning method that automatically generates multi-modal tool-usage data and tunes a vision-language model (VLM) as the controller for powerful tool-usage reasoning. To preserve the data quality, we prompt the GPT-4o mini model to generate queries, files, and trajectories, followed by query-file and trajectory verifiers. Based on the data synthesis pipeline, we collect the MM-Traj dataset that contains 20K tasks with trajectories of tool usage. Then, we develop the T3-Agent via \underline{T}rajectory \underline{T}uning on VLMs for \underline{T}ool usage using MM-Traj. Evaluations on the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the T3-Agent consistently achieves improvements on two popular VLMs: MiniCPM-V-8.5B and {Qwen2-VL-7B}, which outperforms untrained VLMs by $20\%$, showing the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline, leading to high-quality data for tool-usage capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, https://mat-agent.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13720v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis: A Bitcoin Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18158v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

The construction of KGs typically requires significant effort from domain experts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been used for Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). However, most existing approaches focus on a local perspective, extracting knowledge triplets from individual sentences or documents, missing a fusion process to combine the knowledge in a global KG. This work introduces Graphusion, a zero-shot KGC framework from free text. It contains three steps: in Step 1, we extract a list of seed entities using topic modeling to guide the final KG includes the most relevant entities; in Step 2, we conduct candidate triplet extraction using LLMs; in Step 3, we design the novel fusion module that provides a global view of the extracted knowledge, incorporating entity merging, conflict resolution, and novel triplet discovery. Results show that Graphusion achieves scores of 2.92 and 2.37 out of 3 for entity extraction and relation recognition, respectively. Moreover, we showcase how Graphusion could be applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain and validate it in an educational scenario. Specifically, we introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified benchmark for QA, comprising six tasks and a total of 1,200 QA pairs. Using the Graphusion-constructed KG, we achieve a significant improvement on the benchmark, for example, a 9.2% accuracy improvement on sub-graph completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.10794</p></details> |

However, our research reveals that many jailbreaks identified by current evaluations may actually be hallucinations-erroneous outputs that are mistaken for genuine safety breaches. This finding suggests that some perceived vulnerabilities might not represent actual threats, indicating a need for more precise red teaming benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose the $\textbf{B}$enchmark for reli$\textbf{AB}$ilit$\textbf{Y}$ and jail$\textbf{B}$reak ha$\textbf{L}$l$\textbf{U}$cination $\textbf{E}$valuation (BabyBLUE). BabyBLUE introduces a specialized validation framework including various evaluators to enhance existing jailbreak benchmarks, ensuring outputs are useful malicious instructions. Additionally, BabyBLUE presents a new dataset as an augmentation to the existing red teaming benchmarks, specifically addressing hallucinations in jailbreaks, aiming to evaluate the true potential of jailbroken LLM outputs to cause harm to human society.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |

Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter. We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained model's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent evaluation across various models and datasets. We report a comprehensive empirical evaluation using this framework and show that LLMs provide consistent rankings of explanation methods.

| **[Log Parsing using LLMs with Self-Generated In-Context Learning and Self-Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03376v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log parsing transforms log messages into structured formats, serving as a crucial step for log analysis. Despite a variety of log parsers that have been proposed, their performance on evolving log data remains unsatisfactory due to reliance on human-crafted rules or learning-based models with limited training data. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong abilities in understanding natural language and code, making it promising to apply LLMs for log parsing. Consequently, several studies have proposed LLM-based log parsers. However, LLMs may produce inaccurate templates, and existing LLM-based log parsers directly use the template generated by the LLM as the parsing result, hindering the accuracy of log parsing. Furthermore, these log parsers depend heavily on historical log data as demonstrations, which poses challenges in maintaining accuracy when dealing with scarce historical log data or evolving log data. To address these challenges, we propose AdaParser, an effective and adaptive log parsing framework using LLMs with self-generated in-context learning (SG-ICL) and self-correction. To facilitate accurate log parsing, AdaParser incorporates a novel component, a template corrector, which utilizes the LLM to correct potential parsing errors in the templates it generates. In addition, AdaParser maintains a dynamic candidate set composed of previously generated templates as demonstrations to adapt evolving log data. Extensive experiments on public large-scale datasets indicate that AdaParser outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, even in zero-shot scenarios. Moreover, when integrated with different LLMs, AdaParser consistently enhances the performance of the utilized LLMs by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC'25)</p></details> |

However, our study identifies significant risks associated with this technique. First, we demonstrate that autotuning, a method used to auto-select models' roles based on the question, can lead to the generation of harmful outputs, even when the model is tasked with adopting neutral roles. Second, we investigate how different roles affect the likelihood of generating biased or harmful content. Through testing on benchmarks containing stereotypical and harmful questions, we find that role-play consistently amplifies the risk of biased outputs. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of both role simulation and tuning processes when deploying LLMs in sensitive or high-stakes contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, submitted to CogSci 2025</p></details> |

However, DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response is treated as a single arm, ignoring the importance differences between tokens, which may affect optimization efficiency and make it difficult to achieve optimal results. In this work, we propose that the optimal data for DPO has equal expected rewards for each token in winning and losing responses, as there is no difference in token importance. However, since the optimal dataset is unavailable in practice, we propose using the original dataset for importance sampling to achieve unbiased optimization. Accordingly, we propose a token-level importance sampling DPO objective named TIS-DPO that assigns importance weights to each token based on its reward. Inspired by previous works, we estimate the token importance weights using the difference in prediction probabilities from a pair of contrastive LLMs. We explore three methods to construct these contrastive LLMs: (1) guiding the original LLM with contrastive prompts, (2) training two separate LLMs using winning and losing responses, and (3) performing forward and reverse DPO training with winning and losing responses. Experiments show that TIS-DPO significantly outperforms various baseline methods on harmlessness and helpfulness alignment and summarization tasks. We also visualize the estimated weights, demonstrating their ability to identify key token positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables, Published in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents' systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, the CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.

However, this mechanism of latent distribution modeling lacks quantitative understanding and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that any language dataset can be represented by a Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``Data-Tree''), where each node denotes a token, each edge denotes a token transition probability, and each sequence has a unique path. Any GPT-like language model can also be flattened into another Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``GPT-Tree''). Our experiments show that different GPT models trained on the same dataset exhibit significant structural similarity in GPT-Tree visualization, and larger models converge more closely to the Data-Tree. More than 87\% GPT output tokens can be recalled by Data-Tree. These findings may confirm that the reasoning process of LLMs is more likely to be probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning, as each model inference seems to find a context pattern with maximum probability from the Data-Tree. Furthermore, we provide deeper insights into issues such as hallucination, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and token bias in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, generated impersonation posts where 93.9% of them were deemed authentic, and boosted click rate of phishing links in spear phishing emails by 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, To appear in Usenix Security 2025</p></details> |

The fingerprinting of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for ensuring the security and transparency of AI-integrated applications. While existing methods primarily rely on access to direct interactions with the application to infer model identity, they often fail in real-world scenarios involving multi-agent systems, frequent model updates, and restricted access to model internals. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprinting framework designed to address these challenges by integrating static and dynamic fingerprinting techniques. Our approach identifies architectural features and behavioral traits, enabling accurate and robust fingerprinting of LLMs in dynamic environments. We also highlight new threat scenarios where traditional fingerprinting methods are ineffective, bridging the gap between theoretical techniques and practical application. To validate our framework, we present an extensive evaluation setup that simulates real-world conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in identifying and monitoring LLMs in Gen-AI applications. Our results highlight the framework's adaptability to diverse and evolving deployment contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models for Product Bundling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11712v4)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in product bundling have leveraged multimodal information through sophisticated encoders, but remain constrained by limited semantic understanding and a narrow scope of knowledge. Therefore, some attempts employ In-context Learning (ICL) to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for their extensive knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. However, these efforts are inadequate in understanding mulitmodal data and exploiting LLMs' knowledge for product bundling. To bridge the gap, we introduce Bundle-MLLM, a novel framework that fine-tunes LLMs through a hybrid item tokenization approach within a well-designed optimization strategy. Specifically, we integrate textual, media, and relational data into a unified tokenization, introducing a soft separation token to distinguish between textual and non-textual tokens. Additionally, a streamlined yet powerful multimodal fusion module is employed to embed all non-textual features into a single, informative token, significantly boosting efficiency. To tailor product bundling tasks for LLMs, we reformulate the task as a multiple-choice question with candidate items as options. We further propose a progressive optimization strategy that fine-tunes LLMs for disentangled objectives: 1) learning bundle patterns and 2) enhancing multimodal semantic understanding specific to product bundling. Extensive experiments on four datasets across two domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 (CR)</p></details> |

However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To advance this task, we introduce TESRBench, a comprehensive benchmark for temporal event sequence retrieval (TESR) from textual descriptions. TESRBench includes diverse real-world datasets with synthesized and reviewed textual descriptions, providing a strong foundation for evaluating retrieval performance and addressing challenges in this domain. Building on this benchmark, we propose TPP-Embedding, a novel model for embedding and retrieving event sequences. The model leverages the TPP-LLM framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with temporal point processes (TPPs) to encode both event texts and times. By pooling representations and applying a contrastive loss, it unifies temporal dynamics and event semantics in a shared embedding space, aligning sequence-level embeddings of event sequences and their descriptions. TPP-Embedding demonstrates superior performance over baseline models across TESRBench datasets, establishing it as a powerful solution for the temporal event sequence retrieval task.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to investigate how LLMs are currently used in qualitative analysis and their potential applications in software engineering research, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and practices associated with their use. A systematic mapping study was conducted, analyzing 21 relevant studies to explore reported uses of LLMs for qualitative analysis. The findings indicate that LLMs are primarily used for tasks such as coding, thematic analysis, and data categorization, offering benefits like increased efficiency and support for new researchers. However, limitations such as output variability, challenges in capturing nuanced perspectives, and ethical concerns related to privacy and transparency were also identified. The study emphasizes the need for structured strategies and guidelines to optimize LLM use in qualitative research within software engineering, enhancing their effectiveness while addressing ethical considerations. While LLMs show promise in supporting qualitative analysis, human expertise remains crucial for interpreting data, and ongoing exploration of best practices will be vital for their successful integration into empirical software engineering research.</p></details> |  |

However, this swift advancement has also introduced new vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to produce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a significant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. Our SIJ method achieves near 100\% attack success rates on five well-known open-source LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results.

However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.</p></details> |  |

This autophagy could lead to a phenomenon known as model collapse, which entails a degradation in the performance and diversity of generative AI models over successive generations. Recent studies have explored the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and types of data. However, the current characterizations of model collapse tend to be simplistic and lack comprehensive evaluation. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of model collapse across three text datasets, utilizing semantic networks to analyze text repetitiveness and diversity, while employing next-token probabilities to quantify the loss of diversity. We also examine how the proportions of synthetic tokens affect the severity of model collapse and perform cross-dataset evaluations to identify domain-specific variations. By proposing metrics and strategies for a more detailed assessment of model collapse, our study provides new insights for the development of robust generative AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight in NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.</p></details> | Updated Draft |

The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

This would potentially transform search across human candidates, including for marriage and jobs -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun experimenting with training "AI clones" to represent users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones and their imperfect representation of humans. Individuals are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations. I compare two search regimes: an "in-person regime" -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an "AI representation regime" -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a higher expected match quality than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Encode Numbers Using Digit Representations in Base 10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11781v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across the digits of the answer rather than normally around its numeric value. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

| **[Mitigating Information Loss in Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning via Direct Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08761v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant success across various domains, but its adoption is often limited by the black-box nature of neural network policies, making them difficult to interpret. In contrast, symbolic policies allow representing decision-making strategies in a compact and interpretable way. However, learning symbolic policies directly within on-policy methods remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SYMPOL, a novel method for SYMbolic tree-based on-POLicy RL. SYMPOL employs a tree-based model integrated with a policy gradient method, enabling the agent to learn and adapt its actions while maintaining a high level of interpretability. We evaluate SYMPOL on a set of benchmark RL tasks, demonstrating its superiority over alternative tree-based RL approaches in terms of performance and interpretability. Unlike existing methods, it enables gradient-based, end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within standard on-policy RL algorithms. Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees.</p></details> |  |
| **[RILe: Reinforced Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08472v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring complex behaviors is essential for artificially intelligent agents, yet learning these behaviors in high-dimensional settings poses a significant challenge due to the vast search space. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) requires extensive manual effort for reward function engineering. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) uncovers reward functions from expert demonstrations but relies on an iterative process that is often computationally expensive. Imitation learning (IL) provides a more efficient alternative by directly comparing an agent's actions to expert demonstrations; however, in high-dimensional environments, such direct comparisons offer insufficient feedback for effective learning. We introduce RILe (Reinforced Imitation Learning), a framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn a dense reward function efficiently and achieve strong performance in high-dimensional tasks. RILe employs a novel trainer-student framework: the trainer learns an adaptive reward function, and the student uses this reward signal to imitate expert behaviors. By dynamically adjusting its guidance as the student evolves, the trainer provides nuanced feedback across different phases of learning. Our framework produces high-performing policies in high-dimensional tasks where direct imitation fails to replicate complex behaviors. We validate RILe in challenging robotic locomotion tasks, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves near-expert performance across multiple settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide and Conquer: Provably Unveiling the Pareto Front with Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07182v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important challenge in multi-objective reinforcement learning is obtaining a Pareto front of policies to attain optimal performance under different preferences. We introduce Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO), which decomposes finding the Pareto front into a sequence of constrained single-objective problems. This enables us to guarantee convergence while providing an upper bound on the distance to undiscovered Pareto optimal solutions at each step. We evaluate IPRO using utility-based metrics and its hypervolume and find that it matches or outperforms methods that require additional assumptions. By leveraging problem-specific single-objective solvers, our approach also holds promise for applications beyond multi-objective reinforcement learning, such as planning and pathfinding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Learning Rate for Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Bandit Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12598v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) models trained using gradient-based techniques, the choice of optimizer and its learning rate are crucial to achieving good performance: higher learning rates can prevent the model from learning effectively, while lower ones might slow convergence. Additionally, due to the non-stationarity of the objective function, the best-performing learning rate can change over the training steps. To adapt the learning rate, a standard technique consists of using decay schedulers. However, these schedulers assume that the model is progressively approaching convergence, which may not always be true, leading to delayed or premature adjustments. In this work, we propose dynamic Learning Rate for deep Reinforcement Learning (LRRL), a meta-learning approach that selects the learning rate based on the agent's performance during training. LRRL is based on a multi-armed bandit algorithm, where each arm represents a different learning rate, and the bandit feedback is provided by the cumulative returns of the RL policy to update the arms' probability distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that LRRL can substantially improve the performance of deep RL algorithms for some tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Exploration with PAC-Bayes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03055v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real life. Many complex skills build on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor has to learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, a reinforcement learning agent has to perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their successful generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-greedily on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC), is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on a diverse set of continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Combinatorial Rising Bandit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00798v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial online learning is a fundamental task to decide the optimal combination of base arms in sequential interactions with systems providing uncertain rewards, which is applicable to diverse domains such as robotics, social advertising, network routing and recommendation systems. In real-world scenarios, we often observe rising rewards, where the selection of a base arm not only provides an instantaneous reward but also contributes to the enhancement of future rewards, {\it e.g.}, robots enhancing proficiency through practice and social influence strengthening in the history of successful recommendations. To address this, we introduce the problem of combinatorial rising bandit to minimize policy regret and propose a provably efficient algorithm, called Combinatorial Rising Upper Confidence Bound (CRUCB), of which regret upper bound is close to a regret lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies do not provide a sub-linear regret lower bound, making it impossible to assess the efficiency of their algorithms. However, we provide the sub-linear regret lower bound for combinatorial rising bandit and show that CRUCB is provably efficient by showing that the regret upper bound is close to the regret lower bound. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CRUCB not only in synthetic environments but also in realistic applications of deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08820v4)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[SHARPIE: A Modular Framework for Reinforcement Learning and Human-AI Interaction Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19245v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a general approach for modeling and training AI agents, including human-AI interaction scenarios. In this paper, we propose SHARPIE (Shared Human-AI Reinforcement Learning Platform for Interactive Experiments) to address the need for a generic framework to support experiments with RL agents and humans. Its modular design consists of a versatile wrapper for RL environments and algorithm libraries, a participant-facing web interface, logging utilities, deployment on popular cloud and participant recruitment platforms. It empowers researchers to study a wide variety of research questions related to the interaction between humans and RL agents, including those related to interactive reward specification and learning, learning from human feedback, action delegation, preference elicitation, user-modeling, and human-AI teaming. The platform is based on a generic interface for human-RL interactions that aims to standardize the field of study on RL in human contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning often assumes a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors, leading to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. We introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning to enhance the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to address epistemic uncertainty by fully leveraging the GGD. We refine batch inverse variance weighting with bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, enhancing robustness. Experiments with policy gradient algorithms demonstrate significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic expertise meets residual RL: Knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning for CAV trajectory control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17380v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is anticipated to exhibit higher sample efficiency compared to model-free RL by utilizing a virtual environment model. However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

| **[Scrutinize What We Ignore: Reining In Task Representation Shift Of Context-Based Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12001v4)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising approach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by leveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous context-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating optimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance improvements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of maximizing the mutual information between the task variable $M$ and its latent representation $Z$ ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task representation.Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of performance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored.Inspired by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the previous optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of maximizing the expected return, thereby explaining performance improvements. Furthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we observe that the condition for monotonic performance improvements does not consider the variation of the task representation. When these variations are considered, the previously established condition may no longer be sufficient to ensure monotonicity, thereby impairing the optimization process.We name this issue task representation shift and theoretically prove that the monotonic performance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder updates.Our work opens up a new avenue for OMRL, leading to a better understanding between the task representation and performance improvements.</p></details> | Accept at ICLR 2025 |
| **[B3C: A Minimalist Approach to Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18138v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overestimation arising from selecting unseen actions during policy evaluation is a major challenge in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A minimalist approach in the single-agent setting -- adding behavior cloning (BC) regularization to existing online RL algorithms -- has been shown to be effective; however, this approach is understudied in multi-agent settings. In particular, overestimation becomes worse in multi-agent settings due to the presence of multiple actions, resulting in the BC regularization-based approach easily suffering from either over-regularization or critic divergence. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, Behavior Cloning regularization with Critic Clipping (B3C), which clips the target critic value in policy evaluation based on the maximum return in the dataset and pushes the limit of the weight on the RL objective over BC regularization, thereby improving performance. Additionally, we leverage existing value factorization techniques, particularly non-linear factorization, which is understudied in offline settings. Integrated with non-linear value factorization, B3C outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various offline multi-agent benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictable Reinforcement Learning Dynamics through Entropy Rate Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18703v4)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-agnostic Pre-training and Task-guided Fine-tuning for Versatile Diffusion Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19949v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated their capabilities in modeling trajectories of multi-tasks. However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). They are costly due to the substantial human efforts required to collect expert data or design reward functions. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner capable of leveraging large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose SODP, a two-stage framework that leverages Sub-Optimal data to learn a Diffusion Planner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to quickly refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoRL: A GPU-accelerated Framework for Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15129v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (EvoRL) has emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with RL. However, the population-based nature of EC significantly increases computational costs, thereby restricting the exploration of algorithmic design choices and scalability in large-scale settings. To address this challenge, we introduce $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$, the first end-to-end EvoRL framework optimized for GPU acceleration. The framework executes the entire training pipeline on accelerators, including environment simulations and EC processes, leveraging hierarchical parallelism through vectorization and compilation techniques to achieve superior speed and scalability. This design enables the efficient training of large populations on a single machine. In addition to its performance-oriented design, $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$ offers a comprehensive platform for EvoRL research, encompassing implementations of traditional RL algorithms (e.g., A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC), Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g., CMA-ES, OpenES, ARS), and hybrid EvoRL paradigms such as Evolutionary-guided RL (e.g., ERL, CEM-RL) and Population-Based AutoRL (e.g., PBT). The framework's modular architecture and user-friendly interface allow researchers to seamlessly integrate new components, customize algorithms, and conduct fair benchmarking and ablation studies.

| **[The Meta-Representation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02481v3)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans rely on high-level understandings of things, i.e., meta-representations, to engage in abstract reasoning. In complex cognitive tasks, these meta-representations help individuals abstract general rules from experience. However, constructing such meta-representations from high-dimensional observations remains a longstanding challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. For instance, a well-trained agent often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as changes in background color, while humans can easily handle. In this paper, we theoretically investigate how meta-representations contribute to the generalization ability of RL agents, demonstrating that learning meta-representations from high-dimensional observations enhance an agent's ability to generalize across varied environments. We further hypothesize that deep mutual learning (DML) among agents can help them learn the meta-representations that capture the underlying essence of the task. Empirical results provide strong support for both our theory and hypothesis. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on the generalization of deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Reinforcement Learning: From Algorithms to Practical Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18892v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environments. Drawing from the foundations of trial and error, RL equips agents to make informed decisions through feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL, meticulously analyzing a wide range of algorithms, from foundational tabular methods to advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. We categorize and evaluate these algorithms based on key criteria such as scalability, sample efficiency, and suitability. We compare the methods in the form of their strengths and weaknesses in diverse settings. Additionally, we offer practical insights into the selection and implementation of RL algorithms, addressing common challenges like convergence, stability, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness the full potential of RL in solving complex, real-world problems.</p></details> | 79 pages |
| **[Policy Gradient-Driven Noise Mask](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14568v5)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance. In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models. We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks. https://github.com/convergedmachine/Policy-Gradient-Driven-Noise-Mask</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Pattern Recognition (2024) Accepted Paper</p></details> |

Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TurboHopp across multiple drug discovery scenarios, underscoring its potential in diverse molecular settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables.

| **[The Benefits of Being Categorical Distributional: Uncertainty-aware Regularized Exploration in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03155v6)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable empirical performance of distributional reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention to understanding its theoretical advantages over classical RL. By decomposing the categorical distributional loss commonly employed in distributional RL, we find that the potential superiority of distributional RL can be attributed to a derived distribution-matching entropy regularization. This less-studied entropy regularization aims to capture additional knowledge of return distribution beyond only its expectation, contributing to an augmented reward signal in policy optimization. In contrast to the vanilla entropy regularization in MaxEnt RL, which explicitly encourages exploration by promoting diverse actions, the novel entropy regularization derived from categorical distributional loss implicitly updates policies to align the learned policy with (estimated) environmental uncertainty. Finally, extensive experiments substantiate the significance of this uncertainty-aware regularization from distributional RL on the empirical benefits over classical RL. Our study offers a new perspective from the exploration to explain the intrinsic benefits of adopting distributional learning in RL.</p></details> |  |

Counterintuitive Findings from MCTS-Boosted Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15904v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Step-level reward models (SRMs) can significantly enhance mathematical reasoning performance through process supervision or step-level preference alignment based on reinforcement learning. The performance of SRMs is pivotal, as they serve as critical guidelines, ensuring that each step in the reasoning process is aligned with desired outcomes. Recently, AlphaZero-like methods, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed for automatic step-level preference annotation, have proven particularly effective. However, the precise mechanisms behind the success of SRMs remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study delves into the counterintuitive aspects of SRMs, particularly focusing on MCTS-based approaches. Our findings reveal that the removal of natural language descriptions of thought processes has minimal impact on the efficacy of SRMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRMs are adept at assessing the complex logical coherence present in mathematical language while having difficulty in natural language. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of the core elements that drive effective step-level reward modeling in mathematical reasoning. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this study offers valuable guidance for developing more efficient and streamlined SRMs, which can be achieved by focusing on the crucial parts of mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Value Function Decomposition in Markov Recommendation Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17409v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in recommender systems have shown that user-system interaction essentially formulates long-term optimization problems, and online reinforcement learning can be adopted to improve recommendation performance. The general solution framework incorporates a value function that estimates the user's expected cumulative rewards in the future and guides the training of the recommendation policy. To avoid local maxima, the policy may explore potential high-quality actions during inference to increase the chance of finding better future rewards. To accommodate the stepwise recommendation process, one widely adopted approach to learning the value function is learning from the difference between the values of two consecutive states of a user. However, we argue that this paradigm involves a challenge of Mixing Random Factors: there exist two random factors from the stochastic policy and the uncertain user environment, but they are not separately modeled in the standard temporal difference (TD) learning, which may result in a suboptimal estimation of the long-term rewards and less effective action exploration. As a solution, we show that these two factors can be separately approximated by decomposing the original temporal difference loss. The disentangled learning framework can achieve a more accurate estimation with faster learning and improved robustness against action exploration. As an empirical verification of our proposed method, we conduct offline experiments with simulated online environments built on the basis of public datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Three Refinements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05858v5)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex decision-making and control tasks. However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DextrAH-RGB: Visuomotor Policies to Grasp Anything with Dexterous Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01791v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most important, yet challenging, skills for a dexterous robot is grasping a diverse range of objects. Much of the prior work has been limited by speed, generality, or reliance on depth maps and object poses. In this paper, we introduce DextrAH-RGB, a system that can perform dexterous arm-hand grasping end-to-end from RGB image input. We train a privileged fabric-guided policy (FGP) in simulation through reinforcement learning that acts on a geometric fabric controller to dexterously grasp a wide variety of objects. We then distill this privileged FGP into a RGB-based FGP strictly in simulation using photorealistic tiled rendering. To our knowledge, this is the first work that is able to demonstrate robust sim2real transfer of an end2end RGB-based policy for complex, dynamic, contact-rich tasks such as dexterous grasping. DextrAH-RGB is competitive with depth-based dexterous grasping policies, and generalizes to novel objects with unseen geometry, texture, and lighting conditions in the real world. Videos of our system grasping a diverse range of unseen objects are available at \url{https://dextrah-rgb.github.io/}.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we focus on image-based domains where spatially-biased and fully-connected architectures are common.

| **[Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence for Data-Efficient Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12155v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), we train a value function to understand the long-term consequence of executing a single action. However, the value of taking each action can be ambiguous in robotics as robot movements are typically the aggregate result of executing multiple small actions. Moreover, robotic training data often consists of noisy trajectories, in which each action is noisy but executing a series of actions results in a meaningful robot movement. This further makes it difficult for the value function to understand the effect of individual actions. To address this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. We study our algorithm on 53 robotic tasks with sparse and dense rewards, as well as with and without demonstrations, from BiGym, HumanoidBench, and RLBench. We find that CQN-AS outperforms various baselines, in particular on humanoid control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages.

As an emerging research topic, ICRL has received considerable attention in recent years. This article presents a categorical survey of the latest advances in ICRL. It serves as a comprehensive reference for machine learning researchers and practitioners, as well as starters seeking to comprehend the definitions, advancements, and important challenges in ICRL. We begin by formally defining the problem and outlining the algorithmic framework that facilitates constraint inference across various scenarios. These include deterministic or stochastic environments, environments with limited demonstrations, and multiple agents. For each context, we illustrate the critical challenges and introduce a series of fundamental methods to tackle these issues. This survey encompasses discrete, virtual, and realistic environments for evaluating ICRL agents. We also delve into the most pertinent applications of ICRL, such as autonomous driving, robot control, and sports analytics. To stimulate continuing research, we conclude the survey with a discussion of key unresolved questions in ICRL that can effectively foster a bridge between theoretical understanding and practical industrial applications.

| **[Policy Zooming: Adaptive Discretization-based Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18793v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Lipschitz MDPs in the infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) setup in which an agent can play policies from a given set $\Phi$. The proposed algorithms ``zoom'' into ``promising'' regions of the policy space, thereby achieving adaptivity gains. We upper bound their regret as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(T^{1 - d_{\text{eff.}}^{-1}}\big)$, where $d_{\text{eff.}} = d^\Phi_z+2$ for model-free algorithm~\textit{PZRL-MF} and $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2d_\mathcal{S} + d^\Phi_z + 3$ for model-based algorithm~\textit{PZRL-MB}. Here, $d_\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension of the state space, and $d^\Phi_z$ is the zooming dimension. $d^\Phi_z$ is a problem-dependent quantity that depends not only on the underlying MDP, but also on the class $\Phi$. This yields us a low regret in case the agent competes against a low-complexity $\Phi$ (that has a small $d^\Phi_z$). We note that the preexisting notions of zooming dimension are inept at handling the non-episodic RL and do not yield adaptivity gains. The current work shows how to capture adaptivity gains for infinite-horizon average-reward RL in terms of $d^\Phi_z$. When specialized to the case of finite-dimensional policy space, we obtain that $d_{\text{eff.}}$ scales as the dimension of this space under mild technical conditions; and also obtain $d_{\text{eff.}} = 0$, or equivalently $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for \textit{PZRL-MF}, under a curvature condition on the average reward function that is commonly used in the multi-armed bandit (MAB) literature. Simulation experiments validate the gains arising due to adaptivity.</p></details> | 43 pages, 2 figures |

While predictive models may not directly translate to effective design, recent MBO algorithms incorporate reinforcement learning and generative modeling approaches. Meanwhile, theoretical work suggests that exploiting the target function's structure can enhance MBO performance. We present Cliqueformer, a transformer-based architecture that learns the black-box function's structure through functional graphical models (FGM), addressing distribution shift without relying on explicit conservative approaches. Across various domains, including chemical and genetic design tasks, Cliqueformer demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Are In-Context Bandit Reinforcement Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05362v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18101v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training of language models, either through reinforcement learning, preference optimization or supervised finetuning, tends to sharpen the output probability distribution and reduce the diversity of generated responses. This is particularly a problem for creative generative tasks where varied responses are desired. In this work we introduce Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO), an optimization method which learns to generate much more diverse responses than standard pipelines, while maintaining the quality of the generations. In DivPO, preference pairs are selected by first considering a pool of responses, and a measure of diversity among them, and selecting chosen examples as being more rare but high quality, while rejected examples are more common, but low quality. DivPO results in generating 45.6% more diverse persona attributes, and an 74.6% increase in story diversity, while maintaining similar win rates as standard baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vintix: Action Model via In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19400v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code to be released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of \texttt{EPPO} in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Drama: Mamba-Enabled Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Is Sample and Parameter Efficient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08893v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often demands complex and deep architectures, which are expensive to compute and train. Within the world model, dynamics models are particularly crucial for accurate predictions, and various dynamics-model architectures have been explored, each with its own set of challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN) based world models face issues such as vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies effectively. In contrast, use of transformers suffers from the well-known issues of self-attention mechanisms, where both memory and computational complexity scale as $O(n^2)$, with $n$ representing the sequence length. To address these challenges we propose a state space model (SSM) based world model, specifically based on Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and facilitating the use of longer training sequences efficiently. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early stages of training, combining it with the aforementioned technique to achieve a normalised score comparable to other state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms using only a 7 million trainable parameter world model. This model is accessible and can be trained on an off-the-shelf laptop. Our code is available at https://github.com/realwenlongwang/Drama.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Jackpot! Alignment as a Maximal Lottery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19266v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the standard for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, is known to fail to satisfy properties that are intuitively desirable, such as respecting the preferences of the majority \cite{ge2024axioms}. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of a probabilistic Social Choice rule called \emph{maximal lotteries} as a replacement for RLHF. We show that a family of alignment techniques, namely Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) \cite{munos2023nash} and variants, approximate maximal lottery outcomes and thus inherit its beneficial properties. We confirm experimentally that our proposed methodology handles situations that arise when working with preferences more robustly than standard RLHF, including supporting the preferences of the majority, providing principled ways of handling non-transitivities in the preference data, and robustness to irrelevant alternatives. This results in systems that better incorporate human values and respect human intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Objective Metrics for Human-Subjects Evaluation in Explainable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19256v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanation is a fundamentally human process. Understanding the goal and audience of the explanation is vital, yet existing work on explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) routinely does not consult humans in their evaluations. Even when they do, they routinely resort to subjective metrics, such as confidence or understanding, that can only inform researchers of users' opinions, not their practical effectiveness for a given problem. This paper calls on researchers to use objective human metrics for explanation evaluations based on observable and actionable behaviour to build more reproducible, comparable, and epistemically grounded research. To this end, we curate, describe, and compare several objective evaluation methodologies for applying explanations to debugging agent behaviour and supporting human-agent teaming, illustrating our proposed methods using a novel grid-based environment. We discuss how subjective and objective metrics complement each other to provide holistic validation and how future work needs to utilise standardised benchmarks for testing to enable greater comparisons between research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear $Q$-Learning Does Not Diverge: Convergence Rates to a Bounded Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19254v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>$Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. Previously, it is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning to a bounded set. Notably, we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOP-ERL: Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09536v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning (TOP-ERL), a novel algorithm that enables off-policy updates in the ERL framework. In ERL, policies predict entire action trajectories over multiple time steps instead of single actions at every time step. These trajectories are typically parameterized by trajectory generators such as Movement Primitives (MP), allowing for smooth and efficient exploration over long horizons while capturing high-level temporal correlations. However, ERL methods are often constrained to on-policy frameworks due to the difficulty of evaluating state-action values for entire action sequences, limiting their sample efficiency and preventing the use of more efficient off-policy architectures. TOP-ERL addresses this shortcoming by segmenting long action sequences and estimating the state-action values for each segment using a transformer-based critic architecture alongside an n-step return estimation. These contributions result in efficient and stable training that is reflected in the empirical results conducted on sophisticated robot learning environments. TOP-ERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods. Thorough ablation studies additionally show the impact of key design choices on the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/BruceGeLi/TOP_ERL_ICLR25. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.11437</p></details> |
| **[Policy Gradient Methods for Risk-Sensitive Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Provable Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14749v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for maintaining reliable performance in high-stakes applications. While traditional RL methods aim to learn a point estimate of the random cumulative cost, distributional RL (DRL) seeks to estimate the entire distribution of it, which leads to a unified framework for handling different risk measures. However, developing policy gradient methods for risk-sensitive DRL is inherently more complex as it involves finding the gradient of a probability measure. This paper introduces a new policy gradient method for risk-sensitive DRL with general coherent risk measures, where we provide an analytical form of the probability measure's gradient for any distribution. For practical use, we design a categorical distributional policy gradient algorithm (CDPG) that approximates any distribution by a categorical family supported on some fixed points. We further provide a finite-support optimality guarantee and a finite-iteration convergence guarantee under inexact policy evaluation and gradient estimation. Through experiments on stochastic Cliffwalk and CartPole environments, we illustrate the benefits of considering a risk-sensitive setting in DRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis of Autonomous Cyber-Defence Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19206v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rise in increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks raises the need for robust and resilient autonomous cyber-defence (ACD) agents. Given the variety of cyber-attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed, learning approaches that can return generalisable policies are desirable. Meanwhile, the assurance of ACD agents remains an open challenge. We address both challenges via an empirical game-theoretic analysis of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches for ACD using the principled double oracle (DO) algorithm. This algorithm relies on adversaries iteratively learning (approximate) best responses against each others' policies; a computationally expensive endeavour for autonomous cyber operations agents. In this work we introduce and evaluate a theoretically-sound, potential-based reward shaping approach to expedite this process. In addition, given the increasing number of open-source ACD-DRL approaches, we extend the DO formulation to allow for multiple response oracles (MRO), providing a framework for a holistic evaluation of ACD approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The stability of this procedure, i.e., whether it converges to its fixed-point, critically depends on the representations of the state-action pairs. Poorly learned representations can make value function learning unstable, or even divergent. Therefore, it is critical to stabilize value function learning by explicitly shaping the state-action representations. Recently, the class of bisimulation-based algorithms have shown promise in shaping representations for control. However, it is still unclear if this class of methods can stabilize value function learning. In this work, we investigate this question and answer it affirmatively. We introduce a bisimulation-based algorithm called kernel representations for offline policy evaluation (KROPE). KROPE uses a kernel to shape state-action representations such that state-action pairs that have similar immediate rewards and lead to similar next state-action pairs under the target policy also have similar representations. We show that KROPE: 1) learns stable representations and 2) leads to lower value error than baselines. Our analysis provides new theoretical insight into the stability properties of bisimulation-based methods and suggests that practitioners can use these methods for stable and accurate evaluation of offline reinforcement learning agents.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Adaptive Learn-then-Test: Statistically Valid and Efficient Hyperparameter Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15844v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce adaptive learn-then-test (aLTT), an efficient hyperparameter selection procedure that provides finite-sample statistical guarantees on the population risk of AI models. Unlike the existing learn-then-test (LTT) technique, which relies on conventional p-value-based multiple hypothesis testing (MHT), aLTT implements sequential data-dependent MHT with early termination by leveraging e-processes. As a result, aLTT can reduce the number of testing rounds, making it particularly well-suited for scenarios in which testing is costly or presents safety risks. Apart from maintaining statistical validity, in applications such as online policy selection for offline reinforcement learning and prompt engineering, aLTT is shown to achieve the same performance as LTT while requiring only a fraction of the testing rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[APEX: Automated Parameter Exploration for Low-Power Wireless Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19194v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Careful parametrization of networking protocols is crucial to maximize the performance of low-power wireless systems and ensure that stringent application requirements can be met. This is a non-trivial task involving thorough characterization on testbeds and requiring expert knowledge. Unfortunately, the community still lacks a tool to facilitate parameter exploration while minimizing the necessary experimentation time on testbeds. Such a tool would be invaluable, as exhaustive parameter searches can be time-prohibitive or unfeasible given the limited availability of testbeds, whereas non-exhaustive unguided searches rarely deliver satisfactory results. In this paper, we present APEX, a framework enabling an automated and informed parameter exploration for low-power wireless protocols and allowing to converge to an optimal parameter set within a limited number of testbed trials. We design APEX using Gaussian processes to effectively handle noisy experimental data and estimate the optimality of a certain parameter combination. After developing a prototype of APEX, we demonstrate its effectiveness by parametrizing two IEEE 802.15.4 protocols for a wide range of application requirements. Our results show that APEX can return the best parameter set with up to 10.6x, 4.5x and 3.25x less testbed trials than traditional solutions based on exhaustive search, greedy approaches, and reinforcement learning, respectively.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |

A promising solution to this problem is using human-preference alignment techniques, such as best-of-n sampling and reinforcement learning. However, these techniques face the difficulty arising from the scarcity of visual preference data, which is required to train a visual reward model (VRM). In this work, we continue the line of research. We present a Robust Visual Reward Model (RoVRM) which improves human-preference alignment for LVLMs. RoVRM leverages auxiliary textual preference data through a three-phase progressive training and optimal transport-based preference data selection to effectively mitigate the scarcity of visual preference data. We experiment with RoVRM on the commonly used vision-language tasks based on the LLaVA-1.5-7B and -13B models. Experimental results demonstrate that RoVRM consistently outperforms traditional VRMs. Furthermore, our three-phase progressive training and preference data selection approaches can yield consistent performance gains over ranking-based alignment techniques, such as direct preference optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

HVAC devices form a complex thermodynamic system, and while Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning have been used to optimize control policies, scaling to thousands of buildings remains a significant unsolved challenge. Most current algorithms are over-optimized for specific buildings and rely on proprietary data or hard-to-configure simulations. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control benchmark with a focus on solutions that scale. It consists of 3 components: real-world telemetric data extracted from 11 buildings over 6 years, a lightweight data-driven simulator for each building, and a modular Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) building model as a simulator alternative. The buildings span a variety of climates, management systems, and sizes, and both the simulator and PINN easily scale to new buildings, ensuring solutions using this benchmark are robust to these factors and only reliant on fully scalable building models. This represents a major step towards scaling HVAC optimization from the lab to buildings everywhere. To facilitate use, our benchmark is compatible with the Gym standard, and our data is part of TensorFlow Datasets.</p></details> |  |

A key requirement to achieve this is the capacity to "search" chemical space to identify all molecules of interest. Here, we propose a challenging new benchmark to discover dissimilar molecules that possess similar bioactivity, a common scenario in drug discovery, but a hard problem to optimize. We show that a population of RL agents can solve the benchmark, while a single agent cannot. We also find that cooperative strategies are not significantly better than independent agents. Moreover, the performance on the benchmark scales log-linearly with the number of independent agents, showing a test-time training scaling law for chemical language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decorrelated Soft Actor-Critic for Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19133v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL) when dealing with high-dimensional data is influenced by the success of representation learning via deep neural networks, and has implications for the sample efficiency of deep RL algorithms. Input decorrelation has been previously introduced as a method to speed up optimization in neural networks, and has proven impactful in both efficient deep learning and as a method for effective representation learning for deep RL algorithms. We propose a novel approach to online decorrelation in deep RL based on the decorrelated backpropagation algorithm that seamlessly integrates the decorrelation process into the RL training pipeline. Decorrelation matrices are added to each layer, which are updated using a separate decorrelation learning rule that minimizes the total decorrelation loss across all layers, in parallel to minimizing the usual RL loss. We used our approach in combination with the soft actor-critic (SAC) method, which we refer to as decorrelated soft actor-critic (DSAC). Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark with DSAC shows, compared to the regular SAC baseline, faster training in five out of the seven games tested and improved reward performance in two games with around 50% reduction in wall-clock time, while maintaining performance levels on the other games. These results demonstrate the positive impact of network-wide decorrelation in deep RL for speeding up its sample efficiency through more effective credit assignment.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, our approach performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method effectively generalizes reward shaping to sparse reward scenarios, achieving up to four times better performance in reaching higher best scores compared to curiosity-driven methods. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |
