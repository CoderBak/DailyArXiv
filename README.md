| **[A comparison of translation performance between DeepL and Supertext](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02577v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As strong machine translation (MT) systems are increasingly based on large language models (LLMs), reliable quality benchmarking requires methods that capture their ability to leverage extended context. This study compares two commercial MT systems -- DeepL and Supertext -- by assessing their performance on unsegmented texts. We evaluate translation quality across four language directions with professional translators assessing segments with full document-level context. While segment-level assessments indicate no strong preference between the systems in most cases, document-level analysis reveals a preference for Supertext in three out of four language directions, suggesting superior consistency across longer texts. We advocate for more context-sensitive evaluation methodologies to ensure that MT quality assessments reflect real-world usability. We release all evaluation data and scripts for further analysis and reproduction at https://github.com/supertext/evaluation_deepl_supertext.</p></details> |  |

It addresses a long-standing challenge in automating netlist generation for analog circuits within circuit design automation. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of finetuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. We identify key challenges in this automation and evaluate the multi-modal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, to address these issues. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome current limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach aims to create an end-to-end SPICE netlist generator from circuit schematic images, tackling the long-standing hurdle of accurate netlist generation. Our framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, tested on approximately 2,100 schematics of varying complexity. We open-source this solution for community-driven development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Language Models Up to Sequential Optimization Problems? From Evaluation to a Hegelian-Inspired Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02573v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across numerous fields, presenting an opportunity to revolutionize optimization problem-solving, a crucial, ubiquitous, and complex domain. This paper explores the proficiency of LLMs in handling Sequential Optimization Problems (SOPs). We introduce WorldGen, a dynamic framework for generating unseen SOPs with controllable complexities, to evaluate LLM performance. Our initial observations reveal that while LLMs perform well on simple SOPs, their performance significantly degrades with increased complexity. Motivated by this, we revisit philosophical hypotheses on reasoning to enhance LLM performance. Inspired by the influential framework of Hegelian Dialectics, we propose ACE, demonstrating how the performance of LLMs in SOP contexts can be significantly improved without any retraining or further fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the RoPEs: Better 2D and 3D Position Encodings with STRING](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02562v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STRING: Separable Translationally Invariant Position Encodings. STRING extends Rotary Position Encodings, a recently proposed and widely used algorithm in large language models, via a unifying theoretical framework. Importantly, STRING still provides exact translation invariance, including token coordinates of arbitrary dimensionality, whilst maintaining a low computational footprint. These properties are especially important in robotics, where efficient 3D token representation is key. We integrate STRING into Vision Transformers with RGB(-D) inputs (color plus optional depth), showing substantial gains, e.g. in open-vocabulary object detection and for robotics controllers. We complement our experiments with a rigorous mathematical analysis, proving the universality of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos of STRING-based robotics controllers can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/string-robotics</p></details> |
| **[LLMs for Generation of Architectural Components: An Exploratory Empirical Study in the Serverless World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02539v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the exponential growth in capability and pervasiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant work done in the field of code generation. However, this generation has been limited to code snippets. Going one step further, our desideratum is to automatically generate architectural components. This would not only speed up development time, but would also enable us to eventually completely skip the development phase, moving directly from design decisions to deployment. To this end, we conduct an exploratory study on the capability of LLMs to generate architectural components for Functions as a Service (FaaS), commonly known as serverless functions. The small size of their architectural components make this architectural style amenable for generation using current LLMs compared to other styles like monoliths and microservices. We perform the study by systematically selecting open source serverless repositories, masking a serverless function and utilizing state of the art LLMs provided with varying levels of context information about the overall system to generate the masked function. We evaluate correctness through existing tests present in the repositories and use metrics from the Software Engineering (SE) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains to evaluate code quality and the degree of similarity between human and LLM generated code respectively. Along with our findings, we also present a discussion on the path forward for using GenAI in architectural component generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) 2025 Main Track (https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Self-improvement LLM Agentic System for ML Library Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02534v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ML libraries, often written in architecture-specific programming languages (ASPLs) that target domain-specific architectures, are key to efficient ML systems. However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it requires expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, have shown general coding capabilities. However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we construct a benchmark of a typical ML library and generate ASPL code with both open and closed-source LLMs on this benchmark. Our results show improvements of up to $3.9\times$ over a baseline single LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models, employed as multiple agents that interact and collaborate with each other, have excelled at solving complex tasks. The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. We reveal that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, we propose Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. We show that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, we finally propose design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table (30 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Empty Spaces: Human-in-the-Loop Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01088v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is crucial to make machine learning models more robust and safe. However, augmenting data can be challenging as it requires generating diverse data points to rigorously evaluate model behavior on edge cases and mitigate potential harms. Creating high-quality augmentations that cover these "unknown unknowns" is a time- and creativity-intensive task. In this work, we introduce Amplio, an interactive tool to help practitioners navigate "unknown unknowns" in unstructured text datasets and improve data diversity by systematically identifying empty data spaces to explore. Amplio includes three human-in-the-loop data augmentation techniques: Augment With Concepts, Augment by Interpolation, and Augment with Large Language Model. In a user study with 18 professional red teamers, we demonstrate the utility of our augmentation methods in helping generate high-quality, diverse, and relevant model safety prompts. We find that Amplio enabled red teamers to augment data quickly and creatively, highlighting the transformative potential of interactive augmentation workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/apple/ml-interactive-data-augmentation/</p></details> |
| **[Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02508v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartMoE: Mixture of Expert Connector for Advanced Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03277v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[EasySpec: Layer-Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Multi-GPU Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02493v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless method for Large Language Model (LLM) inference acceleration. It employs a smaller model to generate a draft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In multi-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor parallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically smaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting stage. To solve this problem, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation strategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization.EasySpec breaks the sequential execution order of layers in the drafting model, enabling multi-layer parallelization across devices, albeit with some induced approximation errors. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft model's key-value (KV) cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing long-term error accumulation at minimal additional latency. We evaluated EasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of models from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec can achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while preserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the drafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop of only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Machine Translation with Open Large Language Models at Practical Scale: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02481v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown continuously improving multilingual capabilities, and even small-scale open-source models have demonstrated rapid performance enhancement. In this paper, we systematically explore the abilities of open LLMs with less than ten billion parameters to handle multilingual machine translation (MT) tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on six popular LLMs and find that models like Gemma2-9B exhibit impressive multilingual translation capabilities. We then introduce the Parallel-First Monolingual-Second (PFMS) data mixing strategy in the continual pretraining stage to further enhance the MT performance and present GemmaX2-28, a 9B model achieving top-tier multilingual translation performance across 28 languages. Specifically, GemmaX2-28 consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as TowerInstruct and XALMA and achieves competitive performance with Google Translate and GPT-4-turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to NAACL2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Internal Activation as the Polar Star for Steering Unsafe LLM Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01042v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of tasks but also pose significant risks due to their potential to generate harmful content. Although existing safety mechanisms can improve model safety, they often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully utilize LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, where humans rely on reflective reasoning (System 2 thinking) to regulate language and behavior, we empirically demonstrate that LLMs also possess a similar capacity for internal assessment and regulation, which can be actively detected. Building on this insight, we introduce SafeSwitch, a framework that dynamically regulates unsafe outputs by monitoring and utilizing the model's internal states. Our empirical results show that SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by over 80% on safety benchmarks while maintaining strong utility. Compared to traditional safety alignment methods, SafeSwitch delivers more informative and context-aware refusals, demonstrates resilience to unseen queries, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. These features make SafeSwitch a promising approach for implementing nuanced safety controls in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAISA: Towards Multimodal Large Language Models with Both Training and Inference Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02458v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures, each involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding space alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while cross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In this paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for building efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how attention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with each other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary, we propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\textbf{N}o \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{A}mong \textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{T}okens), which eliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that attention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we introduce SAISA (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{I}nput \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and inference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input spaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both self-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\% and training budget by 26\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA across various LLMs and visual encoders. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Beyond English: Evaluating Automated Measurement of Moral Foundations in Non-English Discourse with a Chinese Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02451v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach for Constructing Value Systems in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02444v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMER: Crafting Interactive Extended Reality Worlds with JSON Data Generated by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02441v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with Extended Reality (XR) technologies offers the potential to build truly immersive XR environments that interact with human users through natural language, e.g., generating and animating 3D scenes from audio inputs. However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts. It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors. Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs. Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency. It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user's request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks. Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The analysis of users' feedback also illuminates a series of directions for further optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beemo: Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04032v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has increased the volume of machine-generated texts (MGTs) and blurred text authorship in various domains. However, most existing MGT benchmarks include single-author texts (human-written and machine-generated). This conventional design fails to capture more practical multi-author scenarios, where the user refines the LLM response for natural flow, coherence, and factual correctness. Our paper introduces the Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo), which includes 6.5k texts written by humans, generated by ten instruction-finetuned LLMs, and edited by experts for various use cases, ranging from creative writing to summarization. Beemo additionally comprises 13.1k machine-generated and LLM-edited texts, allowing for diverse MGT detection evaluation across various edit types. We document Beemo's creation protocol and present the results of benchmarking 33 configurations of MGT detectors in different experimental setups. We find that expert-based editing evades MGT detection, while LLM-edited texts are unlikely to be recognized as human-written. Beemo and all materials are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Medical Multimodal Model Stealing Attacks via Adversarial Domain Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02438v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming an instrumental part of healthcare systems, assisting medical personnel with decision making and results analysis. Models for radiology report generation are able to interpret medical imagery, thus reducing the workload of radiologists. As medical data is scarce and protected by privacy regulations, medical MLLMs represent valuable intellectual property. However, these assets are potentially vulnerable to model stealing, where attackers aim to replicate their functionality via black-box access. So far, model stealing for the medical domain has focused on classification; however, existing attacks are not effective against MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Domain Alignment (ADA-STEAL), the first stealing attack against medical MLLMs. ADA-STEAL relies on natural images, which are public and widely available, as opposed to their medical counterparts. We show that data augmentation with adversarial noise is sufficient to overcome the data distribution gap between natural images and the domain-specific distribution of the victim MLLM. Experiments on the IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR radiology datasets demonstrate that Adversarial Domain Alignment enables attackers to steal the medical MLLM without any access to medical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Though research on jailbreak attacks and defenses is emerging, there is no consensus on evaluating jailbreaks, i.e., the methods to assess the harmfulness of an LLM's response are varied. Each approach has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, impacting their alignment with human values, as well as the time and financial cost. This diversity challenges researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and comparing different attacks and defenses. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly 90 jailbreak research published between May 2023 and April 2024. Our study introduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering indepth insights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of their adaptation. To aid further research, we propose JailbreakEval, a toolkit for evaluating jailbreak attempts. JailbreakEval includes various evaluators out-of-the-box, enabling users to obtain results with a single command or customized evaluation workflows. In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a catalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and fosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the Extended Version for the Poster at NDSS Symposium 2025, Feb 24-28, 2025.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective hyperparameter-free preference optimization algorithm for alignment. We observe that promising performance can be achieved simply by optimizing inverse perplexity, which is calculated as the inverse of the exponentiated average log-likelihood of the chosen and rejected responses in the preference dataset. The resulting simple learning objective, SimPER, is easy to implement and eliminates the need for expensive hyperparameter tuning and a reference model, making it both computationally and memory efficient. Extensive experiments on widely used real-world benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2, and 10 key benchmarks of the Open LLM Leaderboard with 5 base models, demonstrate that SimPER consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches-even without any hyperparameters or a reference model . For example, despite its simplicity, SimPER outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 5.7 points on AlpacaEval 2 and achieves the highest average ranking across 10 benchmarks on the Open LLM Leaderboard. The source code for SimPER is publicly available at: https://github.com/tengxiao1/SimPER.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Maybe more so than you think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12091v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation-Informed Merging of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02421v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning~(CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs with up to 40\% increase in benchmark performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current CBMs typically rely on concept sets extracted from large language models or extensive image corpora, limiting their effectiveness in data-sparse scenarios. We propose Data-efficient CBMs (DCBMs), which reduce the need for large sample sizes during concept generation while preserving interpretability. DCBMs define concepts as image regions detected by segmentation or detection foundation models, allowing each image to generate multiple concepts across different granularities. This removes reliance on textual descriptions and large-scale pre-training, making DCBMs applicable for fine-grained classification and out-of-distribution tasks. Attribution analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrates that DCBMs deliver visual concepts that can be localized in test images. By leveraging dataset-specific concepts instead of predefined ones, DCBMs enhance adaptability to new domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[MILU: A Multi-task Indic Language Understanding Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02538v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource and linguistically diverse languages remains a significant challenge in NLP, particularly for languages using non-Latin scripts like those spoken in India. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English, leaving substantial gaps in assessing LLM capabilities in these languages. We introduce MILU, a Multi task Indic Language Understanding Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to address this gap. MILU spans 8 domains and 41 subjects across 11 Indic languages, reflecting both general and culturally specific knowledge. With an India-centric design, incorporates material from regional and state-level examinations, covering topics such as local history, arts, festivals, and laws, alongside standard subjects like science and mathematics. We evaluate over 42 LLMs, and find that current LLMs struggle with MILU, with GPT-4o achieving the highest average accuracy at 74 percent. Open multilingual models outperform language-specific fine-tuned models, which perform only slightly better than random baselines. Models also perform better in high resource languages as compared to low resource ones. Domain-wise analysis indicates that models perform poorly in culturally relevant areas like Arts and Humanities, Law and Governance compared to general fields like STEM. To the best of our knowledge, MILU is the first of its kind benchmark focused on Indic languages, serving as a crucial step towards comprehensive cultural evaluation. All code, benchmarks, and artifacts are publicly available to foster open research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of LLMs using Particle-Based Monte Carlo Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01618v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

| **[Analysis of LLMs vs Human Experts in Requirements Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19297v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures |

Energy Efficiency of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02412v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are used in software development to assist in various tasks, e.g., code generation and code completion, but empirical evaluations of the quality of the results produced by these models focus on correctness and ignore other relevant aspects, such as their performance and energy efficiency. Studying the performance of LLM-produced programs is essential to understand how well LLMs can support the construction of performance- and energy-critical software, such as operating systems, servers, and mobile applications. This paper presents the first study analyzing the energy efficiency and performance of LLM-generated code for three programming languages Python, Java, and C++, on two platforms, a Mac and a PC, leveraging three frontier LLMs, Github Copilot, GPT-4o, and the recently-released OpenAI o1-mini, and targeting ``hard'' programming problems from LeetCode. Our results show that the models are much more successful in generating Python and Java than C++ code.</p></details> |  |

While there are numerous opportunities to use LLMs for supporting research or software engineering tasks, solid science needs rigorous empirical evaluations. However, so far, there are no specific guidelines for conducting and assessing studies involving LLMs in software engineering research. Our focus is on empirical studies that either use LLMs as part of the research process or studies that evaluate existing or new tools that are based on LLMs. This paper contributes the first set of holistic guidelines for such studies. Our goal is to start a discussion in the software engineering research community to reach a common understanding of our standards for high-quality empirical studies involving LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2nd IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (WSESE 2025)</p></details> |

However, we find that SAM performs poorly in domains like natural language processing (NLP), often degrading performance -- even with twice the compute budget. We investigate the discrepancy across domains and find that in the NLP setting, SAM is dominated by regularization of the logit statistics -- instead of improving the geometry of the function itself. We use this observation to develop an alternative algorithm we call Functional-SAM, which regularizes curvature only through modification of the statistics of the overall function implemented by the neural network, and avoids spurious minimization through logit manipulation. Furthermore, we argue that preconditioning the SAM perturbation also prevents spurious minimization, and when combined with Functional-SAM, it gives further improvements. Our proposed algorithms show improved performance over AdamW and SAM baselines when trained for an equal number of steps, in both fixed-length and Chinchilla-style training settings, at various model scales (including billion-parameter scale). On the whole, our work highlights the importance of more precise characterizations of sharpness in broadening the applicability of curvature regularization to large language models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[LV-XAttn: Distributed Cross-Attention for Long Visual Inputs in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02406v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoAT: Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts Framework for Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02390v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employing a 'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted extensive experiments across a range of generative and reasoning tasks. These experiments demonstrated that our framework outperforms conventional inference processes on accuracy, coherence, and diversity. The framework's ability to iteratively expand its search space while retaining contextually relevant information results.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents findings from a 4-week in situ study involving 78 families in China, where we collected and analyzed 602 valid audio recordings (totalling 475 hours) and daily surveys. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to analyze parent-child conversations, we gained a nuanced understanding of emotional and behavioural dynamics that overcomes the limitations of traditional one-time surveys and interviews. Our findings reveal significant emotional shifts in parents before and after homework involvement and summarise a range of positive, neutral and negative parental behaviours. We also catalogue seven common conflicts, with Knowledge Conflict being the most frequent. Notably, we found that even well-intentioned parental behaviours, such as Unlabelled Praise, were significantly positively correlated with specific conflict types. This work advances ubiquitous computing's research to sense and understand complex family dynamics, while offering evidence-based insights for designing future ambient intelligent systems to support healthy family education environments.</p></details> |  |

These contexts often involve multimodal data, including both tabular and textual datasets, making it challenging to represent hidden patterns for obtaining meaningful clusters. This study introduces ERASMO, a framework designed to fine-tune a pretrained language model on textually encoded tabular data and generate embeddings from the fine-tuned model. ERASMO employs a textual converter to transform tabular data into a textual format, enabling the language model to process and understand the data more effectively. Additionally, ERASMO produces contextually rich and structurally representative embeddings through techniques such as random feature sequence shuffling and number verbalization. Extensive experimental evaluations were conducted using multiple datasets and baseline approaches. Our results demonstrate that ERASMO fully leverages the specific context of each tabular dataset, leading to more precise and nuanced embeddings for accurate clustering. This approach enhances clustering performance by capturing complex relationship patterns within diverse tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, published in BRACIS 2024 conference</p></details> |

We investigate gender biases in property taxes. We analyze records of more than 100,000 property tax appeal hearings and more than 2.7 years of associated audio recordings, considering how panelist and appellant genders associate with hearing outcomes. We first observe that female appellants fare systematically worse than male appellants in their hearings. Second, we show that, whereas male appellants' hearing outcomes do not vary meaningfully with the gender composition of the panel they face, those of female appellants' do, such that female appellants obtain systematically lesser (greater) reductions to their home values when facing female (male) panelists. Employing a multi-modal large language model (M-LLM), we next construct measures of participant behavior and tone from hearing audio recordings. We observe markedly different behaviors between male and female appellants and, in the case of male appellants, we find that these differences also depend on the gender of the panelists they face (e.g., male appellants appear to behave systematically more aggressively towards female panelists). In contrast, the behavior of female appellants remains relatively constant, regardless of their panel's gender. Finally, we show that female appellants continue to fare worse in front of female panels, even when we condition upon the appelant's in-hearing behavior and tone. Our results are thus consistent with the idea that gender biases are driven, at least in part, by unvoiced beliefs and perceptions on the part of ARB panelists. Our study documents the presence of gender biases in property appraisal appeal hearings and highlights the potential value of generative AI for analyzing large-scale, unstructured administrative data.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAIR: Improving Safety Alignment with Introspective Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02384v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and harmlessness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become equally critical as their performance in applications. However, existing safety alignment methods typically suffer from safety-performance trade-offs and the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, primarily due to their reliance on direct refusals for malicious queries. In this paper, we propose STAIR, a novel framework that integrates SafeTy Alignment with Itrospective Reasoning. We enable LLMs to identify safety risks through step-by-step analysis by self-improving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with safety awareness. STAIR first equips the model with a structured reasoning capability and then advances safety alignment via iterative preference optimization on step-level reasoning data generated using our newly proposed Safety-Informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (SI-MCTS). We further train a process reward model on this data to guide test-time searches for improved responses. Extensive experiments show that STAIR effectively mitigates harmful outputs while better preserving helpfulness, compared to instinctive alignment strategies. With test-time scaling, STAIR achieves a safety performance comparable to Claude-3.5 against popular jailbreak attacks.

This study evaluates LLMs capability to resolve 127 maintainability issues from 10 GitHub repositories. We use zero-shot prompting for Copilot Chat and Llama 3.1, and few-shot prompting with Llama only. The LLM-generated solutions are assessed for compilation errors, test failures, and new maintainability problems. Llama with few-shot prompting successfully fixed 44.9% of the methods, while Copilot Chat and Llama zero-shot fixed 32.29% and 30%, respectively. However, most solutions introduced errors or new maintainability issues. We also conducted a human study with 45 participants to evaluate the readability of 51 LLM-generated solutions. The human study showed that 68.63% of participants observed improved readability. Overall, while LLMs show potential for fixing maintainability issues, their introduction of errors highlights their current limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Premise-Augmented Reasoning Chains Improve Error Identification in Math reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02362v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a method that bridges the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs with the symbolic reasoning strengths of action languages. Our approach, termed "LLM+AL," leverages the LLM's strengths in semantic parsing and commonsense knowledge generation alongside the action language's proficiency in automated reasoning based on encoded knowledge. We compare LLM+AL against state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Ultra 1.0, and o1-preview, using benchmarks for complex reasoning about actions. Our findings indicate that, although all methods exhibit errors, LLM+AL, with relatively minimal human corrections, consistently leads to correct answers, whereas standalone LLMs fail to improve even with human feedback. LLM+AL also contributes to automated generation of action languages.</p></details> | 42 pages |

While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p></details> |  |

Given their persistence, significant effort is required to detect them and respond effectively. Existing provenance-based attack detection methods often lack interpretability and suffer from high false positive rates, while investigation approaches are either supervised or limited to known attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIELD, a novel approach that combines statistical anomaly detection and graph-based analysis with the contextual analysis capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SHIELD leverages the implicit knowledge of LLMs to uncover hidden attack patterns in provenance data, while reducing false positives and providing clear, interpretable attack descriptions. This reduces analysts' alert fatigue and makes it easier for them to understand the threat landscape. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates SHIELD's effectiveness and computational efficiency in real-world scenarios. SHIELD was shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher precision and recall. SHIELD's integration of anomaly detection, LLM-driven contextual analysis, and advanced graph-based correlation establishes a new benchmark for APT detection.</p></details> |  |

While recent efforts attempt to enhance MLLMs' reasoning by incorporating OpenAI o1-like structured thinking through explicit search structures or teacher-guided distillation, they often struggle to balance performance and efficiency. A critical limitation is their heavy reliance on extensive data and search spaces, resulting in low-efficiency implicit insight extraction and data utilization. To address this, we propose AStar, an Automated Structured thinking paradigm for multimodal reasoning via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). AStar automatically derives high-level cognitive reasoning patterns from limited data using MCTS-powered hierarchical structures. Building on these explicit patterns, we design a unified reasoning framework that seamlessly integrates models' internal reasoning capabilities and external reasoning guidelines, enabling efficient inference with minimal tree iterations. This novel paradigm strikes a compelling balance between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate AStar's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy (54.0$\%$) on the MathVerse benchmark with a 7B backbone, surpassing GPT-4o (50.2$\%$) while maintaining substantial data and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional metrics often struggle with robustness and generalization, particularly in dynamic and volatile market conditions. This paper introduces AlphaSharpe, a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve and optimize financial metrics to discover enhanced risk-return metrics that outperform traditional approaches in robustness and correlation with future performance metrics by employing iterative crossover, mutation, and evaluation. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel use of LLMs to generate and refine financial metrics with implicit domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure that evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-returns, and 2x portfolio performance. Experimental results in a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of discovered metrics, making them highly relevant to portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for data processing and text generation, they often struggle to produce complete data reports that fully meet user expectations. One significant challenge is effectively communicating the entire analysis logic to LLMs. Moreover, determining a comprehensive analysis logic can be mentally taxing for users. To address these challenges, we propose ReSpark, an LLM-based method that leverages existing data reports as references for creating new ones. Given a data table, ReSpark searches for similar-topic reports, parses them into interdependent segments corresponding to analytical objectives, and executes them with new data. It identifies inconsistencies and customizes the objectives, data transformations, and textual descriptions. ReSpark allows users to review real-time outputs, insert new objectives, and modify report content. Its effectiveness was evaluated through comparative and user studies.</p></details> |  |

This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT.

However, DL has shown limitations in solving constrained NP-hard problems often encountered in network optimization, such as those involving quality of service (QoS) or discrete variables like user indices. Current solutions rely on domain-specific architectures or heuristic techniques, and a general DL approach for constrained optimization remains undeveloped. Moreover, even minor changes in communication objectives demand time-consuming retraining, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments where task objectives, constraints, environmental factors, and communication scenarios frequently change. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model for resource allocation optimizer (LLM-RAO), a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to address the complex resource allocation problem while adhering to QoS constraints. By employing a prompt-based tuning strategy to flexibly convey ever-changing task descriptions and requirements to the LLM, LLM-RAO demonstrates robust performance and seamless adaptability in dynamic environments without requiring extensive retraining. Simulation results reveal that LLM-RAO achieves up to a 40% performance enhancement compared to conventional DL methods and up to an $80$\% improvement over analytical approaches. Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating communication objectives, LLM-RAO attains up to 2.9 times the performance of traditional DL-based networks.</p></details> |  |

The first prompt was broad, the second focused on poetic structure, and the third prompt emphasized cultural specificity. To support this analysis, four comparative tables were created. The first table presents the results of the cultural items produced after the three prompts, the second categorizes these outputs based on Aixela framework of Proper nouns and Common expressions, the third table summarizes the cultural items generated by human translators, a custom translation engine, and a Large Language Model. The final table outlines the strategies employed by Chat Generative PreTrained Transformer Pro following the culture specific prompt.

This research aims to conduct a novel comparative analysis of two prominent techniques, fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, in the context of doctor-patient chat conversations with multiple datasets of mixed medical domains. The analysis involves three state-of-the-art models: Llama-2, GPT, and the LSTM model. Employing real-world doctor-patient dialogues, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of models, assessing key metrics such as language quality (perplexity, BLEU score), factual accuracy (fact-checking against medical knowledge bases), adherence to medical guidelines, and overall human judgments (coherence, empathy, safety). The findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, shedding light on their suitability for healthcare applications. Furthermore, the research investigates the robustness of the models in handling diverse patient queries, ranging from general health inquiries to specific medical conditions. The impact of domain-specific knowledge integration is also explored, highlighting the potential for enhancing LLM performance through targeted data augmentation and retrieval strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages |

| **[Flow Q-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02538v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present flow Q-learning (FQL), a simple and performant offline reinforcement learning (RL) method that leverages an expressive flow-matching policy to model arbitrarily complex action distributions in data. Training a flow policy with RL is a tricky problem, due to the iterative nature of the action generation process. We address this challenge by training an expressive one-step policy with RL, rather than directly guiding an iterative flow policy to maximize values. This way, we can completely avoid unstable recursive backpropagation, eliminate costly iterative action generation at test time, yet still mostly maintain expressivity. We experimentally show that FQL leads to strong performance across 73 challenging state- and pixel-based OGBench and D4RL tasks in offline RL and offline-to-online RL.

This report discusses the model, and what its release means for the field of Generative AI more widely. We briefly discuss other models released from China in recent weeks, their similarities; innovative use of Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and clever engineering appear to be key factors in the capabilities of these models. This think piece has been written to a tight time-scale, providing broad coverage of the topic, and serves as introductory material for those looking to understand the model's technical advancements, as well as it's place in the ecosystem. Several further areas of research are identified.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |

Maybe more so than you think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12091v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Graph Generation via Autoregressive Noisy Filtration Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02415v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generative models often face a critical trade-off between learning complex distributions and achieving fast generation speed. We introduce Autoregressive Noisy Filtration Modeling (ANFM), a novel approach that addresses both challenges. ANFM leverages filtration, a concept from topological data analysis, to transform graphs into short sequences of monotonically increasing subgraphs. This formulation extends the sequence families used in previous autoregressive models. To learn from these sequences, we propose a novel autoregressive graph mixer model. Our experiments suggest that exposure bias might represent a substantial hurdle in autoregressive graph generation and we introduce two mitigation strategies to address it: noise augmentation and a reinforcement learning approach. Incorporating these techniques leads to substantial performance gains, making ANFM competitive with state-of-the-art diffusion models across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, ANFM produces remarkably short sequences, achieving a 100-fold speedup in generation time compared to diffusion models. This work marks a significant step toward high-throughput graph generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 27 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Provably Efficient Option-Based Algorithm for both High-Level and Low-Level Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15124v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches have shown successful results in solving a large variety of complex, structured, long-horizon problems. Nevertheless, a full theoretical understanding of this empirical evidence is currently missing. In the context of the \emph{option} framework, prior research has devised efficient algorithms for scenarios where options are fixed, and the high-level policy selecting among options only has to be learned. However, the fully realistic scenario in which both the high-level and the low-level policies are learned is surprisingly disregarded from a theoretical perspective. This work makes a step towards the understanding of this latter scenario. Focusing on the finite-horizon problem, we present a meta-algorithm alternating between regret minimization algorithms instanced at different (high and low) temporal abstractions. At the higher level, we treat the problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), with fixed low-level policies, while at a lower level, inner option policies are learned with a fixed high-level policy. The bounds derived are compared with the lower bound for non-hierarchical finite-horizon problems, allowing to characterize when a hierarchical approach is provably preferable, even without pre-trained options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Achieving Hiding and Smart Anti-Jamming Communication: A Parallel DRL Approach against Moving Reactive Jammer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02385v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of anti-jamming in moving reactive jamming scenarios. The moving reactive jammer initiates high-power tracking jamming upon detecting any transmission activity, and when unable to detect a signal, resorts to indiscriminate jamming. This presents dual imperatives: maintaining hiding to avoid the jammer's detection and simultaneously evading indiscriminate jamming. Spread spectrum techniques effectively reduce transmitting power to elude detection but fall short in countering indiscriminate jamming. Conversely, changing communication frequencies can help evade indiscriminate jamming but makes the transmission vulnerable to tracking jamming without spread spectrum techniques to remain hidden. Current methodologies struggle with the complexity of simultaneously optimizing these two requirements due to the expansive joint action spaces and the dynamics of moving reactive jammers. To address these challenges, we propose a parallelized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy. The approach includes a parallelized network architecture designed to decompose the action space. A parallel exploration-exploitation selection mechanism replaces the $\varepsilon $-greedy mechanism, accelerating convergence. Simulations demonstrate a nearly 90\% increase in normalized throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circular Microalgae-Based Carbon Control for Net Zero](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02382v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alteration of the climate in various areas of the world is of increasing concern since climate stability is a necessary condition for human survival as well as every living organism. The main reason of climate change is the greenhouse effect caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In this paper, we design a networked system underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics to circulate the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Specifically, in the carbon dioxide emitter compartment, we develop an initial-condition-dependent finite-time stabilizing controller that guarantees stability within a desired time leveraging the system property of affinity in the control. Then, to compensate for carbon emissions we show that a cultivation of microalgae with a volume 625 times bigger than the one of the carbon emitter is required. To increase the carbon uptake of the microalgae, we implement the nonaffine-in-the-control microalgae dynamical equations as an environment of a state-of-the-art library for reinforcement learning (RL), namely, Stable-Baselines3, and then, through the library, we test the performance of eight RL algorithms for training a controller that maximizes the microalgae absorption of carbon through the light intensity. All the eight controllers increased the carbon absorption of the cultivation during a training of 200,000 time steps with a maximum episode length of 200 time steps and with no termination conditions. This work is a first step towards approaching net zero as a classical and learning-based network control problem. The source code is publicly available.</p></details> | To be submitted |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Interactive LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01600v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coreset-Based Task Selection for Sample-Efficient Meta-Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02332v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study task selection to enhance sample efficiency in model-agnostic meta-reinforcement learning (MAML-RL). Traditional meta-RL typically assumes that all available tasks are equally important, which can lead to task redundancy when they share significant similarities. To address this, we propose a coreset-based task selection approach that selects a weighted subset of tasks based on how diverse they are in gradient space, prioritizing the most informative and diverse tasks. Such task selection reduces the number of samples needed to find an $\epsilon$-close stationary solution by a factor of O(1/$\epsilon$). Consequently, it guarantees a faster adaptation to unseen tasks while focusing training on the most relevant tasks. As a case study, we incorporate task selection to MAML-LQR (Toso et al., 2024b), and prove a sample complexity reduction proportional to O(log(1/$\epsilon$)) when the task specific cost also satisfy gradient dominance. Our theoretical guarantees underscore task selection as a key component for scalable and sample-efficient meta-RL. We numerically validate this trend across multiple RL benchmark problems, illustrating the benefits of task selection beyond the LQR baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinfier and Reintrainer: Verification and Interpretation-Driven Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15127v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring verifiable and interpretable safety of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is crucial for its deployment in real-world applications. Existing approaches like verification-in-the-loop training, however, face challenges such as difficulty in deployment, inefficient training, lack of interpretability, and suboptimal performance in property satisfaction and reward performance. In this work, we propose a novel verification-driven interpretation-in-the-loop framework Reintrainer to develop trustworthy DRL models, which are guaranteed to meet the expected constraint properties. Specifically, in each iteration, this framework measures the gap between the on-training model and predefined properties using formal verification, interprets the contribution of each input feature to the model's output, and then generates the training strategy derived from the on-the-fly measure results, until all predefined properties are proven. Additionally, the low reusability of existing verifiers and interpreters motivates us to develop Reinfier, a general and fundamental tool within Reintrainer for DRL verification and interpretation. Reinfier features breakpoints searching and verification-driven interpretation, associated with a concise constraint-encoding language DRLP. Evaluations demonstrate that Reintrainer outperforms the state-of-the-art on six public benchmarks in both performance and property guarantees. Our framework can be accessed at https://github.com/Kurayuri/Reinfier.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-Guided Causal State Representation for Offline Reinforcement Learning Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02327v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In offline reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RLRS), learning effective state representations is crucial for capturing user preferences that directly impact long-term rewards. However, raw state representations often contain high-dimensional, noisy information and components that are not causally relevant to the reward. Additionally, missing transitions in offline data make it challenging to accurately identify features that are most relevant to user satisfaction. To address these challenges, we propose Policy-Guided Causal Representation (PGCR), a novel two-stage framework for causal feature selection and state representation learning in offline RLRS. In the first stage, we learn a causal feature selection policy that generates modified states by isolating and retaining only the causally relevant components (CRCs) while altering irrelevant components. This policy is guided by a reward function based on the Wasserstein distance, which measures the causal effect of state components on the reward and encourages the preservation of CRCs that directly influence user interests. In the second stage, we train an encoder to learn compact state representations by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss between the latent representations of the original and modified states, ensuring that the representations focus on CRCs. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the identifiability of causal effects from interventions, validating the ability of PGCR to isolate critical state components for decision-making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGCR significantly improves recommendation performance, confirming its effectiveness for offline RL-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIME:Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02316v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges--primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). DIME leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main text, 18 pages all included</p></details> |

We introduce a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, further enhanced by a tailored Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to dynamically allocate tasks efficiently without necessitating central coordination in a 3D grid environment. The framework minimizes total travel time while simultaneously avoiding conflicts in task assignments. For the cost calculation and routing, we employ reservation-based A* and R* path planners. Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 7.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 20 agents with allocation processing of 2.8 s and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in complex multi-agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (2025)</p></details> |
| **[FRAUD-RLA: A new reinforcement learning adversarial attack against credit card fraud detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02290v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to data-driven systems, and researchers have spent considerable resources studying them. Despite its economic relevance, this trend largely overlooked the issue of credit card fraud detection. To address this gap, we propose a new threat model that demonstrates the limitations of existing attacks and highlights the necessity to investigate new approaches. We then design a new adversarial attack for credit card fraud detection, employing reinforcement learning to bypass classifiers. This attack, called FRAUD-RLA, is designed to maximize the attacker's reward by optimizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and working with significantly less required knowledge than competitors. Our experiments, conducted on three different heterogeneous datasets and against two fraud detection systems, indicate that FRAUD-RLA is effective, even considering the severe limitations imposed by our threat model.</p></details> |  |

Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActSafe: Active Exploration with Safety Constraints for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09486v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is ubiquitous in the development of modern AI systems. However, state-of-the-art RL agents require extensive, and potentially unsafe, interactions with their environments to learn effectively. These limitations confine RL agents to simulated environments, hindering their ability to learn directly in real-world settings. In this work, we present ActSafe, a novel model-based RL algorithm for safe and efficient exploration. ActSafe learns a well-calibrated probabilistic model of the system and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics, while enforcing pessimism w.r.t. the safety constraints. Under regularity assumptions on the constraints and dynamics, we show that ActSafe guarantees safety during learning while also obtaining a near-optimal policy in finite time. In addition, we propose a practical variant of ActSafe that builds on latest model-based RL advancements and enables safe exploration even in high-dimensional settings such as visual control. We empirically show that ActSafe obtains state-of-the-art performance in difficult exploration tasks on standard safe deep RL benchmarks while ensuring safety during learning.</p></details> |  |

| **[Decision Transformer for Enhancing Neural Local Search on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02697v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and its solution algorithms have been of enduring interest in both academia and industry for decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in advancing existing and building new heuristic solutions for the JSSP, aiming to find better solutions in shorter computation times. In this paper we build on top of a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, called Neural Local Search (NLS), which can efficiently and effectively control a large local neighborhood search on the JSSP. In particular, we develop a method for training the decision transformer (DT) algorithm on search trajectories taken by a trained NLS agent to further improve upon the learned decision-making sequences. Our experiments show that the DT successfully learns local search strategies that are different and, in many cases, more effective than those of the NLS agent itself. In terms of the tradeoff between solution quality and acceptable computational time needed for the search, the DT is particularly superior in application scenarios where longer computational times are acceptable. In this case, it makes up for the longer inference times required per search step, which are caused by the larger neural network architecture, through better quality decisions per step. Thereby, the DT achieves state-of-the-art results for solving the JSSP with ML-enhanced search.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Guidance of Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02150v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/flow_guidance.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |

When generated code fails all unit tests, no learning signal is received, hindering progress on complex tasks. To address this, we propose a Process Reward Model (PRM) that delivers dense, line-level feedback on code correctness during generation, mimicking human code refinement and providing immediate guidance. We explore various strategies for training PRMs and integrating them into the RL framework, finding that using PRMs both as dense rewards and for value function initialization significantly boosts performance. Our experimental results also highlight the effectiveness of PRMs in enhancing RL-driven code generation, especially for long-horizon scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Symbolic State Partitioning for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16791v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular reinforcement learning methods cannot operate directly on continuous state spaces. One solution for this problem is to partition the state space. A good partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient exploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes faster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces approximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear relations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as possible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given problem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by symbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space coverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement learning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space partitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance and state space coverage for the learnt policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMP: Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles for Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02977v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The profiled vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a generalization of the heterogeneous capacitated vehicle routing problem (HCVRP) in which the objective is to optimize the routes of vehicles to serve client demands subject to different vehicle profiles, with each having a preference or constraint on a per-client basis. While existing learning methods have shown promise for solving the HCVRP in real-time, no learning method exists to solve the more practical and challenging PVRP. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles (CAMP), a novel approach that learns efficient solvers for PVRP using multi-agent reinforcement learning. CAMP employs a specialized attention-based encoder architecture to embed profiled client embeddings in parallel for each vehicle profile. We design a communication layer between agents for collaborative decision-making across profiled embeddings at each decoding step and a batched pointer mechanism to attend to the profiled embeddings to evaluate the likelihood of the next actions. We evaluate CAMP on two variants of PVRPs: PVRP with preferences, which explicitly influence the reward function, and PVRP with zone constraints with different numbers of agents and clients, demonstrating that our learned solvers achieve competitive results compared to both classical state-of-the-art neural multi-agent models in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

Our empirical analysis reveals that common methods designed to enhance plasticity by maintaining trainability provide limited benefits to generalization. While reinitializing the network can be effective, it also risks losing valuable prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Hare & Tortoise, inspired by the brain's complementary learning system. Hare & Tortoise consists of two components: the Hare network, which rapidly adapts to new information analogously to the hippocampus, and the Tortoise network, which gradually integrates knowledge akin to the neocortex. By periodically reinitializing the Hare network to the Tortoise's weights, our method preserves plasticity while retaining general knowledge. Hare & Tortoise can effectively maintain the network's ability to generalize, which improves advanced reinforcement learning algorithms on the Atari-100k benchmark.

Both approaches are derived from similar fundamental principles, and both are widely used in practical applications, including robotics, process control, energy systems, and autonomous driving. Despite their similarities, MPC and RL follow distinct paradigms that emerged from diverse communities and different requirements. Various technical discrepancies, particularly the role of an environment model as part of the algorithm, lead to methodologies with nearly complementary advantages. Due to their orthogonal benefits, research interest in combination methods has recently increased significantly, leading to a large and growing set of complex ideas leveraging MPC and RL. This work illuminates the differences, similarities, and fundamentals that allow for different combination algorithms and categorizes existing work accordingly. Particularly, we focus on the versatile actor-critic RL approach as a basis for our categorization and examine how the online optimization approach of MPC can be used to improve the overall closed-loop performance of a policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Multi-objective Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Predictive Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02071v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing predictive maintenance (PdM) methods typically focus solely on whether to replace system components without considering the costs incurred by inspection. However, a well-considered approach should be able to minimize Remaining Useful Life (RUL) at engine replacement while maximizing inspection interval. To achieve this, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be introduced. However, due to the sequential and mutually constraining nature of these 2 objectives, conventional MARL is not applicable. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel framework and develops a Sequential Multi-objective Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (SMOMA-PPO) algorithm. Furthermore, to provide comprehensive and effective degradation information to RL agents, we also employed Gated Recurrent Unit, quantile regression, and probability distribution fitting to develop a GRU-based RUL Prediction (GRP) model. Experiments demonstrate that the GRP method significantly improves the accuracy of RUL predictions in the later stages of system operation compared to existing methods. When incorporating its output into SMOMA-PPO, we achieve at least a 15% reduction in average RUL without unscheduled replacements (UR), nearly a 10% increase in inspection interval, and an overall decrease in maintenance costs. Importantly, our approach offers a new perspective for addressing multi-objective maintenance planning with sequential constraints, effectively enhancing system reliability and reducing maintenance expenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[STP: Self-play LLM Theorem Provers with Iterative Conjecturing and Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00212v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.1%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@64).</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

We propose CH-MARL (Constrained Hierarchical Multiagent Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that integrates hierarchical decision-making with dynamic constraint enforcement and fairness-aware reward shaping. CH-MARL employs a real-time constraint-enforcement layer to ensure adherence to global emission caps, while incorporating fairness metrics that promote equitable resource distribution among agents. Experiments conducted in a simulated maritime logistics environment demonstrate considerable reductions in emissions, along with improvements in fairness and operational efficiency. Beyond this domain-specific success, CH-MARL provides a scalable, generalizable solution to multi-agent coordination challenges in constrained, dynamic settings, thus advancing the state of the art in reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAPID: Robust and Agile Planner Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Drone Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02054v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a learning-based visual planner for agile drone flight in cluttered environments. The proposed planner generates collision-free waypoints in milliseconds, enabling drones to perform agile maneuvers in complex environments without building separate perception, mapping, and planning modules. Learning-based methods, such as behavior cloning (BC) and reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrate promising performance in visual navigation but still face inherent limitations. BC is susceptible to compounding errors due to limited expert imitation, while RL struggles with reward function design and sample inefficiency. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework for high-speed visual navigation. By leveraging IRL, it is possible to reduce the number of interactions with simulation environments and improve capability to deal with high-dimensional spaces while preserving the robustness of RL policies. A motion primitive-based path planning algorithm collects an expert dataset with privileged map data from diverse environments, ensuring comprehensive scenario coverage. By leveraging both the acquired expert and learner dataset gathered from the agent's interactions with the simulation environments, a robust reward function and policy are learned across diverse states. While the proposed method is trained in a simulation environment only, it can be directly applied to real-world scenarios without additional training or tuning. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both simulation and real-world environments, including forests and various structures. The trained policy achieves an average speed of 7 m/s and a maximum speed of 8.8 m/s in real flight experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply an IRL framework for high-speed visual navigation of drones.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 58 references, and appendix is included</p></details> |
| **[A Method for Evaluating Hyperparameter Sensitivity in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07165v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of modern reinforcement learning algorithms critically relies on tuning ever-increasing numbers of hyperparameters. Often, small changes in a hyperparameter can lead to drastic changes in performance, and different environments require very different hyperparameter settings to achieve state-of-the-art performance reported in the literature. We currently lack a scalable and widely accepted approach to characterizing these complex interactions. This work proposes a new empirical methodology for studying, comparing, and quantifying the sensitivity of an algorithm's performance to hyperparameter tuning for a given set of environments. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology by assessing the hyperparameter sensitivity of several commonly used normalization variants of PPO. The results suggest that several algorithmic performance improvements may, in fact, be a result of an increased reliance on hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | Neurips 2024 |
| **[Dual Ensembled Multiagent Q-Learning with Hypernet Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02018v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overestimation in single-agent reinforcement learning has been extensively studied. In contrast, overestimation in the multiagent setting has received comparatively little attention although it increases with the number of agents and leads to severe learning instability. Previous works concentrate on reducing overestimation in the estimation process of target Q-value. They ignore the follow-up optimization process of online Q-network, thus making it hard to fully address the complex multiagent overestimation problem. To solve this challenge, in this study, we first establish an iterative estimation-optimization analysis framework for multiagent value-mixing Q-learning. Our analysis reveals that multiagent overestimation not only comes from the computation of target Q-value but also accumulates in the online Q-network's optimization. Motivated by it, we propose the Dual Ensembled Multiagent Q-Learning with Hypernet Regularizer algorithm to tackle multiagent overestimation from two aspects. First, we extend the random ensemble technique into the estimation of target individual and global Q-values to derive a lower update target. Second, we propose a novel hypernet regularizer on hypernetwork weights and biases to constrain the optimization of online global Q-network to prevent overestimation accumulation. Extensive experiments in MPE and SMAC show that the proposed method successfully addresses overestimation across various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, AAMAS 2025 version with appendix</p></details> |

Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8+18), preprint for discussion.

Our framework incorporates market-specific features and short-term price dynamics to generate more precise trading signals.

To bridge this gap, we fine-tune the LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct model using a custom RLMF prompt design that integrates historical market data and reward-based feedback. Our evaluation shows that this RLMF-tuned framework outperforms baseline methods in signal consistency and achieving tighter trading outcomes; awarded as winner of Task II.

Anthropological evidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally consisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual resemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and, separately, the evolution of pictographic writing systems through a computational lens, most employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear analogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and formulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage visual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model, which is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds light on the cognitive and cultural processes that led to the development of early writing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under submission to a non-archival conference, published here with permission from organizers</p></details> |
| **[Bottom-Up Reputation Promotes Cooperation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01971v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reputation serves as a powerful mechanism for promoting cooperation in multi-agent systems, as agents are more inclined to cooperate with those of good social standing. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods typically rely on predefined social norms to assign reputations, the question of how a population reaches a consensus on judgement when agents hold private, independent views remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up reputation learning method, Learning with Reputation Reward (LR2), designed to promote cooperative behaviour through rewards shaping based on assigned reputation. Our agent architecture includes a dilemma policy that determines cooperation by considering the impact on neighbours, and an evaluation policy that assigns reputations to affect the actions of neighbours while optimizing self-objectives. It operates using local observations and interaction-based rewards, without relying on centralized modules or predefined norms. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of LR2 across various spatial social dilemma scenarios. Interestingly, we find that LR2 stabilizes and enhances cooperation not only with reward reshaping from bottom-up reputation but also by fostering strategy clustering in structured populations, thereby creating environments conducive to sustained cooperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAMAS 2025 (24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems)</p></details> |
| **[DHP: Discrete Hierarchical Planning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01956v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenge of long-horizon visual planning tasks using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our key contribution is a Discrete Hierarchical Planning (DHP) method, an alternative to traditional distance-based approaches. We provide theoretical foundations for the method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluations. Our agent recursively predicts subgoals in the context of a long-term goal and receives discrete rewards for constructing plans as compositions of abstract actions. The method introduces a novel advantage estimation strategy for tree trajectories, which inherently encourages shorter plans and enables generalization beyond the maximum tree depth. The learned policy function allows the agent to plan efficiently, requiring only $\log N$ computational steps, making re-planning highly efficient. The agent, based on a soft-actor critic (SAC) framework, is trained using on-policy imagination data. Additionally, we propose a novel exploration strategy that enables the agent to generate relevant training examples for the planning modules. We evaluate our method on long-horizon visual planning tasks in a 25-room environment, where it significantly outperforms previous benchmarks at success rate and average episode length. Furthermore, an ablation study highlights the individual contributions of key modules to the overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (16 pages, 7 figures).

However, existing testbeds often focus on purely virtual simulations or limited robot morphologies such as robotic arms, quadrupeds, and humanoids, leaving high-mobility platforms with real-world physical constraints like drones underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present VolleyBots, a new MARL testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots features a turn-based interaction model under volleyball rules, a hierarchical decision-making process that combines motion control and strategic play, and a high-fidelity simulation for seamless sim-to-real transfer. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative MARL and game-theoretic algorithms. Results in simulation show that while existing algorithms handle simple tasks effectively, they encounter difficulty in complex tasks that require both low-level control and high-level strategy. We further demonstrate zero-shot deployment of a simulation-learned policy to real-world drones, highlighting VolleyBots' potential to propel MARL research involving agile robotic platforms.

| **[Reinforcement Learning with Segment Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01876v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard reinforcement learning (RL) assumes that an agent can observe a reward for each state-action pair. However, in practical applications, it is often difficult and costly to collect a reward for each state-action pair. While there have been several works considering RL with trajectory feedback, it is unclear if trajectory feedback is inefficient for learning when trajectories are long. In this work, we consider a model named RL with segment feedback, which offers a general paradigm filling the gap between per-state-action feedback and trajectory feedback. In this model, we consider an episodic Markov decision process (MDP), where each episode is divided into $m$ segments, and the agent observes reward feedback only at the end of each segment. Under this model, we study two popular feedback settings: binary feedback and sum feedback, where the agent observes a binary outcome and a reward sum according to the underlying reward function, respectively. To investigate the impact of the number of segments $m$ on learning performance, we design efficient algorithms and establish regret upper and lower bounds for both feedback settings. Our theoretical and experimental results show that: under binary feedback, increasing the number of segments $m$ decreases the regret at an exponential rate; in contrast, surprisingly, under sum feedback, increasing $m$ does not reduce the regret significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inversely Learning Transferable Rewards via Abstracted States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01669v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has progressed significantly toward accurately learning the underlying rewards in both discrete and continuous domains from behavior data. The next advance is to learn {\em intrinsic} preferences in ways that produce useful behavior in settings or tasks which are different but aligned with the observed ones. In the context of robotic applications, this helps integrate robots into processing lines involving new tasks (with shared intrinsic preferences) without programming from scratch. We introduce a method to inversely learn an abstract reward function from behavior trajectories in two or more differing instances of a domain. The abstract reward function is then used to learn task behavior in another separate instance of the domain. This step offers evidence of its transferability and validates its correctness. We evaluate the method on trajectories in tasks from multiple domains in OpenAI's Gym testbed and AssistiveGym and show that the learned abstract reward functions can successfully learn task behaviors in instances of the respective domains, which have not been seen previously.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Transferability of Rewards Recovered via Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01793v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer a reward from expert demonstrations, motivated by the idea that the reward, rather than the policy, is the most succinct and transferable description of a task [Ng et al., 2000]. However, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it unclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the sense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to the expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the assumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability when learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition laws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this work, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's policy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we have access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank condition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity and dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two key results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition laws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different transition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local changes in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore, we also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an end-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of multiple experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

In particular, we study nonexpansive stochastic approximations with Markovian noise, providing both asymptotic and finite sample analysis. Key to our analysis are a few novel bounds of noise terms resulting from the Poisson equation. As an application, we prove, for the first time, that the classical tabular average reward temporal difference learning converges to a sample path dependent fixed point.</p></details> |  |

Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.08400</p></details> |

By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT reduces dependence on accurate simulators and tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior DT-based approaches</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce PrefVLM, a framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with selective human feedback to significantly reduce annotation requirements while maintaining performance. Our method leverages VLMs to generate initial preference labels, which are then filtered to identify uncertain cases for targeted human annotation. Additionally, we adapt VLMs using a self-supervised inverse dynamics loss to improve alignment with evolving policies. Experiments on Meta-World manipulation tasks demonstrate that PrefVLM achieves comparable or superior success rates to state-of-the-art methods while using up to 2 x fewer human annotations. Furthermore, we show that adapted VLMs enable efficient knowledge transfer across tasks, further minimizing feedback needs. Our results highlight the potential of combining VLMs with selective human supervision to make preference-based RL more scalable and practical.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
