| **[Where's the Bug? Attention Probing for Scalable Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13966v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring code correctness remains a challenging problem even as large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at code-related tasks. While LLM-based program repair systems can propose bug fixes using only a user's bug report, their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by their ability to perform fault localization (FL), a challenging problem for both humans and LLMs. Existing FL approaches rely on executable test cases, require training on costly and often noisy line-level annotations, or demand resource-intensive LLMs. In this paper, we present Bug Attention Probe (BAP), a method which learns state-of-the-art fault localization without any direct localization labels, outperforming traditional FL baselines and prompting of large-scale LLMs. We evaluate our approach across a variety of code settings, including real-world Java bugs from the standard Defects4J dataset as well as seven other datasets which span a diverse set of bug types and languages. Averaged across all eight datasets, BAP improves by 34.6% top-1 accuracy compared to the strongest baseline and 93.4% over zero-shot prompting GPT-4o. BAP is also significantly more efficient than prompting, outperforming large open-weight models at a small fraction of the computational cost.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuDAF: Long-Context Multi-Document Attention Focusing through Contrastive Learning on Attention Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13963v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently show distracted attention due to irrelevant information in the input, which severely impairs their long-context capabilities. Inspired by recent studies on the effectiveness of retrieval heads in long-context factutality, we aim at addressing this distraction issue through improving such retrieval heads directly. We propose Multi-Document Attention Focusing (MuDAF), a novel method that explicitly optimizes the attention distribution at the head level through contrastive learning. According to the experimental results, MuDAF can significantly improve the long-context question answering performance of LLMs, especially in multi-document question answering. Extensive evaluations on retrieval scores and attention visualizations show that MuDAF possesses great potential in making attention heads more focused on relevant information and reducing attention distractions.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Is That Your Final Answer? Test-Time Scaling Improves Selective Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13962v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIDDIA: Language-based Intelligent Drug Discovery Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13959v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, relying heavily on human medicinal chemists, who can spend years searching the vast space of potential therapies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry have sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, there remains a critical need for an intelligent agent that can navigate the drug discovery process. Towards this end, we introduce LIDDiA, an autonomous agent capable of intelligently navigating the drug discovery process in silico. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models, LIDDiA serves as a low-cost and highly-adaptable tool for autonomous drug discovery. We comprehensively examine LIDDiA, demonstrating that (1) it can generate molecules meeting key pharmaceutical criteria on over 70% of 30 clinically relevant targets, (2) it intelligently balances exploration and exploitation in the chemical space, and (3) it can identify promising novel drug candidates on EGFR, a critical target for cancers.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence via large language models and coherence-driven inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13953v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We devise an algorithm to generate sets of propositions that objectively instantiate graphs that support coherence-driven inference. We then benchmark the ability of large language models (LLMs) to reconstruct coherence graphs from (a straightforward transformation of) propositions expressed in natural language, with promising results from a single prompt to models optimized for reasoning. Combining coherence-driven inference with consistency evaluations by neural models may advance the state of the art in machine cognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Committee: Reasoning Distillation from a Mixture of Teachers with Peer-Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03663v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning capabilities typically emerge in large language models (LLMs) with tens of billions of parameters, recent research focuses on improving smaller open-source models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. However, many of these studies rely solely on responses from a single LLM as the gold rationale, unlike the natural human learning process, which involves understanding both the correct answers and the reasons behind mistakes. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware DistIllation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongPO: Long Context Self-Evolution of Large Language Models through Short-to-Long Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13922v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities through pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may underperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context alignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality of human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing short- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context tasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses LLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising paired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs and their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference reveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context alignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios. Additionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate short-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully retains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in both long- and short-context tasks. Specifically, \ourMethod-trained models can achieve results on long-context benchmarks comparable to, or even surpassing, those of superior LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-128K) that involve extensive long-context annotation and larger parameter scales.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Exploring Code Language Models for Automated HLS-based Hardware Generation: Benchmark, Infrastructure and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13921v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming languages such as Python and C++, opening new opportunities for automating software development and enhancing programmer productivity. The potential of LLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring automated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors have been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages (HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of available HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for software programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored for software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone. Third, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens compared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to generate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code generation for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the literature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and evaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level HDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first finetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a collected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An LLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code generation, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback loops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe of this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by ASP-DAC'25</p></details> |

Current methods often provide data-driven suggestions but may not be feasible and adaptive to real-life constraints and individual contexts. We present HealthGuru, a novel large language model-powered chatbot to enhance sleep health through data-driven, theory-guided, and adaptive recommendations with conversational behavior change support. HealthGuru's multi-agent framework integrates wearable device data, contextual information, and a contextual multi-armed bandit model to suggest tailored sleep-enhancing activities. The system facilitates natural conversations while incorporating data-driven insights and theoretical behavior change techniques. Our eight-week in-the-wild deployment study with 16 participants compared HealthGuru to a baseline chatbot. Results show improved metrics like sleep duration and activity scores, higher quality responses, and increased user motivation for behavior change with HealthGuru. We also identify challenges and design considerations for personalization and user engagement in health chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[How Do LLMs Perform Two-Hop Reasoning in Context?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13913v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Socrates is human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." This classical example demonstrates two-hop reasoning, where a conclusion logically follows from two connected premises. While transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) can make two-hop reasoning, they tend to collapse to random guessing when faced with distracting premises. To understand the underlying mechanism, we train a three-layer transformer on synthetic two-hop reasoning tasks. The training dynamics show two stages: a slow learning phase, where the 3-layer transformer performs random guessing like LLMs, followed by an abrupt phase transitions, where the 3-layer transformer suddenly reaches $100%$ accuracy. Through reverse engineering, we explain the inner mechanisms for how models learn to randomly guess between distractions initially, and how they learn to ignore distractions eventually. We further propose a three-parameter model that supports the causal claims for the mechanisms to the training dynamics of the transformer. Finally, experiments on LLMs suggest that the discovered mechanisms generalize across scales. Our methodologies provide new perspectives for scientific understandings of LLMs and our findings provide new insights into how reasoning emerges during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Sequence: Do Large Language Models Understand Sequential Recommendation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13909v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/LLM-SRec.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Judging the Judges: A Collection of LLM-Generated Relevance Judgements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13908v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for relevance assessments offers promising opportunities to improve Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and related fields. Indeed, LLMs hold the promise of allowing IR experimenters to build evaluation collections with a fraction of the manual human labor currently required. This could help with fresh topics on which there is still limited knowledge and could mitigate the challenges of evaluating ranking systems in low-resource scenarios, where it is challenging to find human annotators. Given the fast-paced recent developments in the domain, many questions concerning LLMs as assessors are yet to be answered. Among the aspects that require further investigation, we can list the impact of various components in a relevance judgment generation pipeline, such as the prompt used or the LLM chosen. This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where different relevance assessment approaches were proposed. In detail, we release and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in the challenge. Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models, analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques.

Recent related benchmarks have primarily focused on single tasks, easily obtainable ground truth, and straightforward evaluation metrics, which limits the scope of tasks that can be evaluated. In contrast, DataSciBench is constructed based on a more comprehensive and curated collection of natural and challenging prompts for uncertain ground truth and evaluation metrics. We develop a semi-automated pipeline for generating ground truth (GT) and validating evaluation metrics. This pipeline utilizes and implements an LLM-based self-consistency and human verification strategy to produce accurate GT by leveraging collected prompts, predefined task types, and aggregate functions (metrics). Furthermore, we propose an innovative Task - Function - Code (TFC) framework to assess each code execution outcome based on precisely defined metrics and programmatic rules. Our experimental framework involves testing 6 API-based models, 8 open-source general models, and 9 open-source code generation models using the diverse set of prompts we have gathered. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of LLMs in data science, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results demonstrate that API-based models outperform open-sourced models on all metrics and Deepseek-Coder-33B-Instruct achieves the highest score among open-sourced models. We release all code and data at https://github.com/THUDM/DataSciBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[CoSQA+: Pioneering the Multi-Choice Code Search Benchmark with Test-Driven Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11589v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic code search, retrieving code that matches a given natural language query, is an important task to improve productivity in software engineering. Existing code search datasets face limitations: they rely on human annotators who assess code primarily through semantic understanding rather than functional verification, leading to potential inaccuracies and scalability issues. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook the multi-choice nature of code search. This paper introduces CoSQA+, pairing high-quality queries from CoSQA with multiple suitable codes. We develop an automated pipeline featuring multiple model-based candidate selections and the novel test-driven agent annotation system. Among a single Large Language Model (LLM) annotator and Python expert annotators (without test-based verification), agents leverage test-based verification and achieve the highest accuracy of 96.4%. Through extensive experiments, CoSQA+ has demonstrated superior quality over CoSQA. Models trained on CoSQA+ exhibit improved performance.

| **[SPEX: Scaling Feature Interaction Explanations for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13870v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized machine learning due to their ability to capture complex interactions between input features. Popular post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP provide marginal feature attributions, while their extensions to interaction importances only scale to small input lengths ($\approx 20$). We propose Spectral Explainer (SPEX), a model-agnostic interaction attribution algorithm that efficiently scales to large input lengths ($\approx 1000)$. SPEX exploits underlying natural sparsity among interactions -- common in real-world data -- and applies a sparse Fourier transform using a channel decoding algorithm to efficiently identify important interactions. We perform experiments across three difficult long-context datasets that require LLMs to utilize interactions between inputs to complete the task. For large inputs, SPEX outperforms marginal attribution methods by up to 20% in terms of faithfully reconstructing LLM outputs. Further, SPEX successfully identifies key features and interactions that strongly influence model output. For one of our datasets, HotpotQA, SPEX provides interactions that align with human annotations. Finally, we use our model-agnostic approach to generate explanations to demonstrate abstract reasoning in closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o mini) and compositional reasoning in vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Size doesn't Fit All: A Personalized Conversational Tutoring Agent for Mathematics Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12633v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed in various intelligent educational systems, simulating human tutors to facilitate effective human-machine interaction. However, previous studies often overlook the significance of recognizing and adapting to individual learner characteristics. Such adaptation is crucial for enhancing student engagement and learning efficiency, particularly in mathematics instruction, where diverse learning styles require personalized strategies to promote comprehension and enthusiasm. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{P}erson\textbf{A}lized \textbf{C}onversational tutoring ag\textbf{E}nt (PACE) for mathematics instruction. PACE simulates students' learning styles based on the Felder and Silverman learning style model, aligning with each student's persona. In this way, our PACE can effectively assess the personality of students, allowing to develop individualized teaching strategies that resonate with their unique learning styles. To further enhance students' comprehension, PACE employs the Socratic teaching method to provide instant feedback and encourage deep thinking. By constructing personalized teaching data and training models, PACE demonstrates the ability to identify and adapt to the unique needs of each student, significantly improving the overall learning experience and outcomes. Moreover, we establish multi-aspect evaluation criteria and conduct extensive analysis to assess the performance of personalized teaching. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in personalizing the educational experience and motivating students compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To address these constraints, we propose a novel text-to-traffic scene framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to autonomously generate diverse traffic scenarios for the CARLA simulator based on natural language descriptions. Our pipeline comprises several key stages: (1) Prompt Analysis, where natural language inputs are decomposed; (2) Road Retrieval, selecting optimal roads from a database; (3) Agent Planning, detailing agent types and behaviors; (4) Road Ranking, scoring roads to match scenario requirements; and (5) Scene Generation, rendering the planned scenarios in the simulator. This framework supports both routine and critical traffic scenarios, enhancing its applicability. We demonstrate that our approach not only diversifies agent planning and road selection but also significantly reduces the average collision rate from 8% to 3.5% in SafeBench. Additionally, our framework improves narration and reasoning for driving captioning tasks.

However, the iterative BOND algorithm is prohibitively expensive in practice due to the sample and computation inefficiency. This paper addresses the problem by revealing a unified game-theoretic connection between iterative BOND and self-play alignment, which unifies seemingly disparate algorithmic paradigms. Based on the connection, we establish a novel framework, WIN rate Dominance (WIND), with a series of efficient algorithms for regularized win rate dominance optimization that approximates iterative BOND in the parameter space. We provides provable sample efficiency guarantee for one of the WIND variant with the square loss objective. The experimental results confirm that our algorithm not only accelerates the computation, but also achieves superior sample efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09713v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the 1970s, information retrieval (IR) has long been defined as the process of acquiring relevant information items from a pre-defined corpus to satisfy user information needs. Traditional IR systems, while effective in domains like web search, are constrained by their reliance on static, pre-defined information items. To this end, this paper introduces agentic information retrieval (Agentic IR), a transformative next-generation paradigm for IR driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. The central shift in agentic IR is the evolving definition of ``information'' from static, pre-defined information items to dynamic, context-dependent information states. Information state refers to a particular information context that the user is right in within a dynamic environment, encompassing not only the acquired information items but also real-time user preferences, contextual factors, and decision-making processes. In such a way, traditional information retrieval, focused on acquiring relevant information items based on user queries, can be naturally extended to achieving the target information state given the user instruction, which thereby defines the agentic information retrieval. We systematically discuss agentic IR from various aspects, i.e., task formulation, architecture, evaluation, case studies, as well as challenges and future prospects. We believe that the concept of agentic IR introduced in this paper not only broadens the scope of information retrieval research but also lays the foundation for a more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent next-generation IR paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, perspective paper</p></details> |

While text-to-image generation has made strides in photorealistic imagery, creating accurate geometric diagrams remains a challenge due to the need for precise spatial relationships and the scarcity of geometry-specific datasets. This paper presents MagicGeo, a training-free framework for generating geometric diagrams from textual descriptions. MagicGeo formulates the diagram generation process as a coordinate optimization problem, ensuring geometric correctness through a formal language solver, and then employs coordinate-aware generation. The framework leverages the strong language translation capability of large language models, while formal mathematical solving ensures geometric correctness. We further introduce MagicGeoBench, a benchmark dataset of 220 geometric diagram descriptions, and demonstrate that MagicGeo outperforms current methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. This work provides a scalable, accurate solution for automated diagram generation, with significant implications for educational and academic applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce CoT-Rec, a framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-driven recommendations by incorporating two crucial processes: user preference analysis and item perception evaluation. CoT-Rec operates in two key phases: (1) personalized data extraction, where user preferences and item perceptions are identified, and (2) personalized data application, where this information is leveraged to refine recommendations. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that CoT-Rec improves recommendation accuracy by making better use of LLMs' reasoning potential.

However, existing methods struggle with cross-domain scenarios due to inefficient memory structures, leading to irrelevant information retention and failure to account for social influence factors such as popularity. To address these limitations, we introduce AgentCF++, a novel framework featuring a dual-layer memory architecture and a two-step fusion mechanism to filter domain-specific preferences effectively. Additionally, we propose interest groups with shared memory, allowing the model to capture the impact of popularity trends on users with similar interests. Through extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets, AgentCF++ demonstrates superior performance over baseline models, highlighting its effectiveness in refining user behavior simulation for recommender systems.

Empirical analysis reveals challenging tokens induce abrupt gradient spikes across layers, exposing architectural stress points in standard Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose Inner Thinking Transformer (ITT), which reimagines layer computations as implicit thinking steps. ITT dynamically allocates computation through Adaptive Token Routing, iteratively refines representations via Residual Thinking Connections, and distinguishes reasoning phases using Thinking Step Encoding. ITT enables deeper processing of critical tokens without parameter expansion. Evaluations across 162M-466M parameter models show ITT achieves 96.5\% performance of a 466M Transformer using only 162M parameters, reduces training data by 43.2\%, and outperforms Transformer/Loop variants in 11 benchmarks. By enabling elastic computation allocation during inference, ITT balances performance and efficiency through architecture-aware optimization of implicit thinking pathways.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. Our results reveal the extent to which finetuned models rely on memorization. In contrast, retrieval-augmented VLMs have lower memorization scores, at the cost of accuracy (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work to reconcile memorization and generalization in both Open-Domain QA and joint Retrieval-QA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proving Olympiad Inequalities by Synergizing LLMs and Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13834v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can prove mathematical theorems formally by generating proof steps (\textit{a.k.a.} tactics) within a proof system. However, the space of possible tactics is vast and complex, while the available training data for formal proofs is limited, posing a significant challenge to LLM-based tactic generation. To address this, we introduce a neuro-symbolic tactic generator that synergizes the mathematical intuition learned by LLMs with domain-specific insights encoded by symbolic methods. The key aspect of this integration is identifying which parts of mathematical reasoning are best suited to LLMs and which to symbolic methods. While the high-level idea of neuro-symbolic integration is broadly applicable to various mathematical problems, in this paper, we focus specifically on Olympiad inequalities (Figure~1). We analyze how humans solve these problems and distill the techniques into two types of tactics: (1) scaling, handled by symbolic methods, and (2) rewriting, handled by LLMs. In addition, we combine symbolic tools with LLMs to prune and rank the proof goals for efficient proof search. We evaluate our framework on 161 challenging inequalities from multiple mathematics competitions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforming existing LLM and symbolic approaches without requiring additional training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

Current MLLM evaluation methods, which rely on subjective human scoring or costly interviews, lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. This paper proposes a process-oriented Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) space design to facilitate more accurate MLLM assessment and development. This approach aids teachers in efficient art evaluation while also recording interactions for MLLM capability assessment. We introduce ArtMentor, a comprehensive space that integrates a dataset and three systems to optimize MLLM evaluation. The dataset consists of 380 sessions conducted by five art teachers across nine critical dimensions. The modular system includes agents for entity recognition, review generation, and suggestion generation, enabling iterative upgrades. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques ensure the reliability of evaluations. The results confirm GPT-4o's effectiveness in assisting teachers in art evaluation dialogues.

However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies have examined bias in individual LLMs, comparisons of bias across models remain underexplored. To address this gap, we analyze 13 LLMs from five families, evaluating bias through output distribution across multiple dimensions using two datasets (4K and 1M questions). Our results show that fine-tuning has minimal impact on output distributions, and proprietary models tend to overly response as unknowns to minimize bias, compromising accuracy and utility. In addition, open-source models like Llama3-Chat and Gemma2-it demonstrate fairness comparable to proprietary models like GPT-4, challenging the assumption that larger, closed-source models are inherently less biased. We also find that bias scores for disambiguated questions are more extreme, raising concerns about reverse discrimination. These findings highlight the need for improved bias mitigation strategies and more comprehensive evaluation metrics for fairness in LLMs.</p></details> | under review |

However, only a limited amount of labeled data is available in practical applications, which poses a severe challenge for SFT in yielding satisfactory results. Therefore, a data-efficient framework that can fully exploit labeled and unlabeled data for LLM fine-tuning is highly anticipated.Towards this end, we introduce a semi-supervised fine-tuning(SemiFT) task and a framework named SemiEvol for LLM alignment from a propagate-and-select manner. For knowledge propagation, SemiEvol adopts a bi-level approach, propagating knowledge from labeled data to unlabeled data through both in-weight and in-context methods. For knowledge selection, SemiEvol incorporates a collaborative learning mechanism, selecting higher-quality pseudo-response samples. We conducted experiments using GPT-4o-mini and Llama-3.1 on seven general or domain-specific datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance on target data. Furthermore, we compared SemiEvol with SFT and self-evolution methods, highlighting its practicality in hybrid data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/luo-junyu/SemiEvol</p></details> |

If we could accurately simulate group-level survey results, this would therefore be very valuable to social science research. Prior work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for simulating human behaviors, mostly through prompting. In this paper, we are the first to specialize LLMs for the task of simulating survey response distributions. As a testbed, we use country-level results from two global cultural surveys. We devise a fine-tuning method based on first-token probabilities to minimize divergence between predicted and actual response distributions for a given question. Then, we show that this method substantially outperforms other methods and zero-shot classifiers, even on unseen questions, countries, and a completely unseen survey. While even our best models struggle with the task, especially on unseen questions, our results demonstrate the benefits of specialization for simulation, which may accelerate progress towards sufficiently accurate simulation in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, accepted to NAACL 2025 main</p></details> |

Model scaling-up offers a promising solution by leveraging the parameters of smaller models to create larger ones. However, existing depth scaling-up methods rely on empirical heuristic rules for layer duplication, which result in poorer initialization and slower convergence during continual pre-training. We propose \textbf{LESA}, a novel learnable method for depth scaling-up. By concatenating parameters from each layer and applying Singular Value Decomposition, we uncover latent patterns between layers, suggesting that inter-layer parameters can be learned. LESA uses a neural network to predict the parameters inserted between adjacent layers, enabling better initialization and faster training. Experiments show that LESA outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior performance with less than half the computational cost during continual pre-training. Extensive analyses demonstrate its effectiveness across different model sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, are they also able to effectively collaborate over long-term interactions? To investigate this, we introduce MemoryCode, a synthetic multi-session dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to track and execute simple coding instructions amid irrelevant information, simulating a realistic setting. While all the models we tested handle isolated instructions well, even the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o deteriorates when instructions are spread across sessions. Our analysis suggests this is due to their failure to retrieve and integrate information over long instruction chains. Our results highlight a fundamental limitation of current LLMs, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively in long interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in personalized education remains limited due to an overemphasis on correctness over error diagnosis and feedback generation. Current models fail to provide meaningful insights into the causes of student mistakes, limiting their utility in educational contexts. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions. First, we introduce \textbf{MathCCS} (Mathematical Classification and Constructive Suggestions), a multi-modal benchmark designed for systematic error analysis and tailored feedback. MathCCS includes real-world problems, expert-annotated error categories, and longitudinal student data. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models, including \textit{Qwen2-VL}, \textit{LLaVA-OV}, \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} and \textit{GPT-4o}, reveal that none achieved classification accuracy above 30\% or generated high-quality suggestions (average scores below 4/10), highlighting a significant gap from human-level performance. Second, we develop a sequential error analysis framework that leverages historical data to track trends and improve diagnostic precision. Finally, we propose a multi-agent collaborative framework that combines a Time Series Agent for historical analysis and an MLLM Agent for real-time refinement, enhancing error classification and feedback generation. Together, these contributions provide a robust platform for advancing personalized education, bridging the gap between current AI capabilities and the demands of real-world teaching.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in feature interaction and user behavior modeling have significantly enhanced the recall and ranking processes of these systems. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to further improve recommendation systems. This tutorial explores two primary approaches for integrating LLMs: LLMs-enhanced recommendations, which leverage the reasoning capabilities of general LLMs, and generative large recommendation models, which focus on scaling and sophistication. While the former has been extensively covered in existing literature, the latter remains underexplored. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of generative large recommendation models, including their recent advancements, challenges, and potential research directions. Key topics include data quality, scaling laws, user behavior mining, and efficiency in training and inference.

Machine Translation (MT) has become a global tool, with cross-lingual services now also supported by dialogue systems powered by multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). This accessibility has expanded MT's reach to a vast base of lay users, often with little to no expertise in the languages or the technology itself. Despite this, the understanding of MT consumed by this diverse group of users -- their needs, experiences, and interactions with these systems -- remains limited. This paper traces the shift in MT user profiles, focusing on non-expert users and how their engagement with these systems may change with LLMs. We identify three key factors -- usability, trust, and literacy -- that shape these interactions and must be addressed to align MT with user needs. By exploring these dimensions, we offer insights to guide future MT with a user-centered approach.</p></details> |  |

However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities. This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions. Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains. This work highlights the limitations of current approaches and lays the groundwork for developing health-specific alignment solutions.</p></details> | Under review |

The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code.

SCALAR features automatic generation of high-quality ground truth labels without human annotation, controllable difficulty levels, and a dynamic updating mechanism that prevents data contamination. Using ICLR 2025 papers, we evaluate 8 state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing key insights about their capabilities and limitations in processing long scientific documents across different context lengths and reasoning types.

In this work we present automated evaluations of LLMs for public health tasks involving the classification and extraction of free text. We combine six externally annotated datasets with seven new internally annotated datasets to evaluate LLMs for processing text related to: health burden, epidemiological risk factors, and public health interventions. We evaluate eleven open-weight LLMs (7-123 billion parameters) across all tasks using zero-shot in-context learning. We find that Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct is the highest performing model, achieving the best results on 8/16 tasks (using micro-F1 scores). We see significant variation across tasks with all open-weight LLMs scoring below 60% micro-F1 on some challenging tasks, such as Contact Classification, while all LLMs achieve greater than 80% micro-F1 on others, such as GI Illness Classification. For a subset of 11 tasks, we also evaluate three GPT-4 and GPT-4o series models and find comparable results to Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Overall, based on these initial results we find promising signs that LLMs may be useful tools for public health experts to extract information from a wide variety of free text sources, and support public health surveillance, research, and interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages.

However, prior research highlights that LLMs often overlook input-label mapping information in ICL, relying more on their pre-trained knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce In-Context Contrastive Decoding (ICCD), a novel method that emphasizes input-label mapping by contrasting the output distributions between positive and negative in-context examples. Experiments on 7 natural language understanding (NLU) tasks show that our ICCD method brings consistent and significant improvement (up to +2.1 improvement on average) upon 6 different scales of LLMs without requiring additional training. Our approach is versatile, enhancing performance with various demonstration selection methods, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.

While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. A series of recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the current literature have yet striked a high-quality balance between (a) effectively aligning the time series and natural language modalities, and (b) keeping the inference efficiency. To address the above issues, we now propose the Time-LlaMA framework. Time-LlaMA first converts the time series input into token embeddings through a linear tokenization mechanism. Second, the time series token embeddings are aligned with the text prompts. Third, to further adapt the LLM backbone for time series modeling, we have developed a dynamic low-rank adaptation technique (D-LoRA). D-LoRA dynamically chooses the most suitable LoRA modules at each layer of the Transformer backbone for each time series input, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. Our experimental results on an extensive collection of challenging real-world time series tasks confirm that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods relying on preference labels, DVO utilizes value signals at individual reasoning steps, optimizing models via a mean squared error loss. The key benefit of DVO lies in its fine-grained supervision, circumventing the need for labor-intensive human annotations. Target values within the DVO are estimated using either Monte Carlo Tree Search or an outcome value model. Our empirical analysis on both mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks shows that DVO consistently outperforms existing offline preference optimization techniques, even with fewer training steps. These findings underscore the importance of value signals in advancing reasoning capabilities and highlight DVO as a superior methodology under scenarios lacking explicit human preference information.</p></details> | preprint |

However, traditional reward models often assign arbitrary and inconsistent scores, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a Pairwise Judge Reward Model (PariJudge RM) combined with a knockout tournament for BoN sampling. Instead of assigning absolute scores, given one math problem, PariJudge RM judges two candidate solutions' correctness with chain-of-thought reasoning simultaneously. This approach eliminates the need for scoring and enables cross-validation of solutions through parallel judgment. In the knockout tournament, PariJudge RM conducts pairwise Judgment between candidate solutions and eliminates the incorrect ones iteratively. We construct PairJudge-432K, a large-scale dataset of 432K pairwise judgments derived from NumiaMath and annotated using \texttt{gemini-1.5-flash}, and train the PariJudge RM via supervised fine-tuning. Experiments on MATH-500 and the Olympiad Bench demonstrate significant improvements over baseline reward models. And a 40\% to 60\% relative improvement is achieved on the top 50\% challenging problems.</p></details> | in progress work |

Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.</p></details> |  |

However, their substantial computational requirements present challenges for practical deployment. Model quantization has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce memory usage and computational costs by employing lower precision and bit-width representations. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of quantization on mathematical reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that aggressive quantization methods like AWQ and GPTQ introduce up to 32.39% accuracy degradation (average 11.31%) on Llama-3 models, particularly in numerical computation and reasoning planning. To address this, we introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework combining qualitative capability analysis and quantitative error assessment. We further develop targeted recovery strategies, showing that fine-tuning quantized models on only 545 task-specific examples for 3 minutes on 4 GPUs effectively restores reasoning capabilities to near full-precision levels. Additionally, our error assessment pipeline achieves 98.9% accuracy in diagnosing and localizing errors across 3,366 failure cases, providing actionable insights for mitigating quantization-induced degradation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate (M-MAD), a systematic LLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that M-MAD achieves significant advancements by (1) decoupling heuristic MQM criteria into distinct evaluation dimensions for fine-grained assessments; (2) employing multi-agent debates to harness the collaborative reasoning capabilities of LLMs; (3) synthesizing dimension-specific results into a final evaluation judgment to ensure robust and reliable outcomes. Comprehensive experiments show that M-MAD not only outperforms all existing LLM-as-a-judge methods but also competes with state-of-the-art reference-based automatic metrics, even when powered by a suboptimal model like GPT-4o mini.

However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using three strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts (likely containing novel specialized knowledge), Wikipedia articles (presumably part of training data), and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.</p></details> |  |

Our main idea is to combine two classic techniques for optimistic exploration: additive exploration bonuses applied to the reward function, and artificial transitions made to an absorbing state with maximal return. We show that, combined with a regularized approximate dynamic-programming scheme, the resulting algorithm achieves a regret of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{d^3 (1 - \gamma)^{- 7 / 2} T})$, where $T$ is the total number of sample transitions, $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is the discount factor, and $d$ is the feature dimensionality. The results continue to hold against adversarial reward sequences, enabling application of our method to the problem of imitation learning in linear MDPs, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning methods cannot be directly transferred to new environments, as they typically rely on extensive mapping and exploration, leading to time-consuming and inefficient. To address these challenges, we try to transfer the logical knowledge and the generalization ability of pre-trained foundation models to zero-shot navigation. By integrating a large vision-language model with a diffusion network, our approach named \mname ~constructs a visual predictor that continuously predicts the agent's potential observations in the next step which can assist robots generate robust actions. Furthermore, to adapt the temporal property of navigation, we introduce temporal historical information to ensure that the predicted image is aligned with the navigation scene. We then carefully designed an information fusion framework that embeds the predicted future frames as guidance into goal-reaching policy to solve downstream image navigation tasks. This approach enhances navigation control and generalization across both simulated and real-world environments. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our method, showcasing its potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of robotic navigation in diverse settings.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2025 |

Towards generalizable distributed manipulation, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for the automatic discovery of control policies. In the face of the massively redundant actions, we propose to reshape the action space by considering the spatially local action patch and the low-frequency actions in the frequency domain. With this reshaped action space, we train RL agents that can relocate diverse objects through tactile observations only. Surprisingly, we find that the discovered policy can not only generalize to unseen object shapes in the simulator but also transfer to the physical robot without any domain randomization. Leveraging the deployed policy, we present abundant real-world manipulation tasks, illustrating the vast potential of RL on ArrayBot for distributed manipulation.</p></details> | ICRA24 |
| **[Uncertainty quantification for Markov chains with application to temporal difference learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13822v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chains are fundamental to statistical machine learning, underpinning key methodologies such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and temporal difference (TD) learning in reinforcement learning (RL). Given their widespread use, it is crucial to establish rigorous probabilistic guarantees on their convergence, uncertainty, and stability. In this work, we develop novel, high-dimensional concentration inequalities and Berry-Esseen bounds for vector- and matrix-valued functions of Markov chains, addressing key limitations in existing theoretical tools for handling dependent data. We leverage these results to analyze the TD learning algorithm, a widely used method for policy evaluation in RL. Our analysis yields a sharp high-probability consistency guarantee that matches the asymptotic variance up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we establish a $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ distributional convergence rate for the Gaussian approximation of the TD estimator, measured in convex distance. These findings provide new insights into statistical inference for RL algorithms, bridging the gaps between classical stochastic approximation theory and modern reinforcement learning applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to explore when mistakes are not allowed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13801v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) provides a versatile framework for developing unified controllers capable of handling wide ranges of tasks, exploring environments, and adapting behaviors. However, its reliance on trial-and-error poses challenges for real-world applications, as errors can result in costly and potentially damaging consequences. To address the need for safer learning, we propose a method that enables agents to learn goal-conditioned behaviors that explore without the risk of making harmful mistakes. Exploration without risks can seem paradoxical, but environment dynamics are often uniform in space, therefore a policy trained for safety without exploration purposes can still be exploited globally. Our proposed approach involves two distinct phases. First, during a pretraining phase, we employ safe reinforcement learning and distributional techniques to train a safety policy that actively tries to avoid failures in various situations. In the subsequent safe exploration phase, a goal-conditioned (GC) policy is learned while ensuring safety. To achieve this, we implement an action-selection mechanism leveraging the previously learned distributional safety critics to arbitrate between the safety policy and the GC policy, ensuring safe exploration by switching to the safety policy when needed. We evaluate our method in simulated environments and demonstrate that it not only provides substantial coverage of the goal space but also reduces the occurrence of mistakes to a minimum, in stark contrast to traditional GCRL approaches. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and analyze failure modes, offering insights for future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, Published as an extended abstract at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |
| **[User Agency and System Automation in Interactive Intelligent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13779v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing user agency and system automation is essential for effective human-AI interactions. Fully automated systems can deliver efficiency but risk undermining usability and user autonomy, while purely manual tools are often inefficient and fail to enhance user capabilities. This dissertation addresses the question: "How can we balance user agency and system automation for interactions with intelligent systems?" We present four main contributions. First, we develop a spherical electromagnet that provides adjustable forces on an untethered tool, allowing haptic feedback while preserving user agency. Second, we create an integrated sensing and actuation system that tracks a passive magnetic tool in 3D and delivers haptic feedback without external tracking. Third, we propose an optimal control method for electromagnetic haptic guidance that balances user input with system control, enabling users to adjust trajectories and speed. Finally, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach for adaptive interfaces that learns interface adaptations without heuristics or real user data. Our simulations and user studies show that shared control significantly outperforms naive strategies. By incorporating explicit or implicit models of human behavior into control strategies, intelligent systems can better account for user agency. We demonstrate that the trade-off between agency and automation is both an algorithmic challenge and an engineering concern, shaped by the design of physical devices and user interfaces. We advocate an integrated, end-to-end approach-combining algorithmic, engineering, and design perspectives-to enable more intuitive and effective interactions with intelligent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Value Optimization: Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs with Refined Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13723v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Direct Value Optimization (DVO), an innovative reinforcement learning framework for enhancing large language models in complex reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional methods relying on preference labels, DVO utilizes value signals at individual reasoning steps, optimizing models via a mean squared error loss. The key benefit of DVO lies in its fine-grained supervision, circumventing the need for labor-intensive human annotations. Target values within the DVO are estimated using either Monte Carlo Tree Search or an outcome value model. Our empirical analysis on both mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks shows that DVO consistently outperforms existing offline preference optimization techniques, even with fewer training steps. These findings underscore the importance of value signals in advancing reasoning capabilities and highlight DVO as a superior methodology under scenarios lacking explicit human preference information.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Hierarchical RL-MPC for Demand Response Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13714v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a hierarchical framework for demand response optimization in air separation units (ASUs) that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with linear model predictive control (LMPC). We investigate two control architectures: a direct RL approach and a control-informed methodology where an RL agent provides setpoints to a lower-level LMPC. The proposed RL-LMPC framework demonstrates improved sample efficiency during training and better constraint satisfaction compared to direct RL control. Using an industrial ASU case study, we show that our approach successfully manages operational constraints while optimizing electricity costs under time-varying pricing. Results indicate that the RL-LMPC architecture achieves comparable economic performance to direct RL while providing better robustness and requiring fewer training samples to converge. The framework offers a practical solution for implementing flexible operation strategies in process industries, bridging the gap between data-driven methods and traditional control approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[User Association and Coordinated Beamforming in Cognitive Aerial-Terrestrial Networks: A Safe Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13663v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive aerial-terrestrial networks (CATNs) offer a solution to spectrum scarcity by sharing spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. However, aerial users (AUs) experience significant interference from numerous terrestrial base stations (BSs). To alleviate such interference, we investigate a user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the aerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the terrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary terrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the AUs. Traditional iterative optimization schemes are impractical due to their high computational complexity and information exchange overhead. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their performance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for violating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we propose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating the need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before actual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained partially observable Markov game. Each TU acts as an agent to choose its associated BS, and each BS acts as an agent to decide its beamforming vectors, aiming to maximize the reward while satisfying the safety constraints introduced by the interference constraints of the AUs. By exploiting a safe DRL algorithm, the proposed scheme incurs lower deployment expenses than the penalty-based DRL schemes since only one training is required before actual deployment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher sum rate of TUs than a two-stage optimization scheme while the average received interference power of the AUs is generally below the threshold.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Finding Optimal Trading History in Reinforcement Learning for Stock Market Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12537v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the optimization of temporal windows in Financial Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models using 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a novel approach to treating the temporal field as a hyperparameter and examine its impact on model performance across various datasets and feature arrangements. We introduce a new hyperparameter for the CNN policy, proposing that this temporal field can and should be treated as a hyperparameter for these models. We examine the significance of this temporal field by iteratively expanding the window of observations presented to the CNN policy during the deep reinforcement learning process. Our iterative process involves progressively increasing the observation period from two weeks to twelve weeks, allowing us to examine the effects of different temporal windows on the model's performance. This window expansion is implemented in two settings. In one setting, we rearrange the features in the dataset to group them by company, allowing the model to have a full view of company data in its observation window and CNN kernel. In the second setting, we do not group the features by company, and features are arranged by category. Our study reveals that shorter temporal windows are most effective when no feature rearrangement to group per company is in effect. However, the model will utilize longer temporal windows and yield better performance once we introduce the feature rearrangement. To examine the consistency of our findings, we repeated our experiment on two datasets containing the same thirty companies from the Dow Jones Index but with different features in each dataset and consistently observed the above-mentioned patterns. The result is a trading model significantly outperforming global financial services firms such as the Global X Guru by the established Mirae Asset.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonoForce: Learnable Image-conditioned Physics Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10156v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel model for the prediction of robot trajectories on rough offroad terrain from the onboard camera images. This model enforces the laws of classical mechanics through a physics-aware neural symbolic layer while preserving the ability to learn from large-scale data as it is end-to-end differentiable. The proposed hybrid model integrates a black-box component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer. This layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real images that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning or SLAM. The codes and data are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ctu-vras/monoforce</p></details> |

Experimental results revealed that search performance was relatively consistent across most methods. The real challenge emerged in simultaneously searching and tracking targets. The multi-headed self-attention architecture demonstrated the most promising results, highlighting the potential of sequence-capable architectures in handling dynamic tracking scenarios.

| **[Model Evolution Framework with Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13569v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning employs a single policy to complete various tasks, aiming to develop an agent with generalizability across different scenarios. Given the shared characteristics of tasks, the agent's learning efficiency can be enhanced through parameter sharing. Existing approaches typically use a routing network to generate specific routes for each task and reconstruct a set of modules into diverse models to complete multiple tasks simultaneously. However, due to the inherent difference between tasks, it is crucial to allocate resources based on task difficulty, which is constrained by the model's structure. To this end, we propose a Model Evolution framework with Genetic Algorithm (MEGA), which enables the model to evolve during training according to the difficulty of the tasks. When the current model is insufficient for certain tasks, the framework will automatically incorporate additional modules, enhancing the model's capabilities. Moreover, to adapt to our model evolution framework, we introduce a genotype module-level model, using binary sequences as genotype policies for model reconstruction, while leveraging a non-gradient genetic algorithm to optimize these genotype policies. Unlike routing networks with fixed output dimensions, our approach allows for the dynamic adjustment of the genotype policy length, enabling it to accommodate models with a varying number of modules. We conducted experiments on various robotics manipulation tasks in the Meta-World benchmark. Our state-of-the-art performance demonstrated the effectiveness of the MEGA framework. We will release our source code to the public.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods face several limitations: inference-phase techniques (e.g., Chain of Thoughts) rely on prompt selection and the pretrained knowledge; sentence-level Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with step-wise mathematical correctness and depend on stronger models distillation or human annotations; while Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches incur high GPU memory costs and unstable training. To address these, we propose \textbf{S}elf-training framework integrating \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{P}reference learning using \textbf{D}ynamic value margin (SPPD). SPPD leverages a process-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman optimality equation to derive \textbf{dynamic value margin} on step-level preference optimization, which employs tree-based self-sampling on model responses \textbf{without any distillation} from other models. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that SPPD is \textbf{equivalent to on-policy policy gradient methods} under reward constraints. Experiments on 7B-scale models demonstrate superior performance across in-domain and out-domain mathematical benchmarks.

| **[Improving Collision-Free Success Rate For Object Goal Visual Navigation Via Two-Stage Training With Collision Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13498v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The object goal visual navigation is the task of navigating to a specific target object using egocentric visual observations. Recent end-to-end navigation models based on deep reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable performance in finding and reaching target objects. However, the collision problem of these models during navigation remains unresolved, since the collision is typically neglected when evaluating the success. Although incorporating a negative reward for collision during training appears straightforward, it results in a more conservative policy, thereby limiting the agent's ability to reach targets. In addition, many of these models utilize only RGB observations, further increasing the difficulty of collision avoidance without depth information. To address these limitations, a new concept -- collision-free success is introduced to evaluate the ability of navigation models to find a collision-free path towards the target object. A two-stage training method with collision prediction is proposed to improve the collision-free success rate of the existing navigation models using RGB observations. In the first training stage, the collision prediction module supervises the agent's collision states during exploration to learn to predict the possible collision. In the second stage, leveraging the trained collision prediction, the agent learns to navigate to the target without collision. The experimental results in the AI2-THOR environment demonstrate that the proposed method greatly improves the collision-free success rate of different navigation models and outperforms other comparable collision-avoidance methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning of Multi-robot Task Allocation for Multi-object Transportation with Infeasible Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11817v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object transport using multi-robot systems has the potential for diverse practical applications such as delivery services owing to its efficient individual and scalable cooperative transport. However, allocating transportation tasks of objects with unknown weights remains challenging. Moreover, the presence of infeasible tasks (untransportable objects) can lead to robot stoppage (deadlock). This paper proposes a framework for dynamic task allocation that involves storing task experiences for each task in a scalable manner with respect to the number of robots. First, these experiences are broadcasted from the cloud server to the entire robot system. Subsequently, each robot learns the exclusion levels for each task based on those task experiences, enabling it to exclude infeasible tasks and reset its task priorities. Finally, individual transportation, cooperative transportation, and the temporary exclusion of tasks considered infeasible are achieved. The scalability and versatility of the proposed method were confirmed through numerical experiments with an increased number of robots and objects, including unlearned weight objects. The effectiveness of the temporary deadlock avoidance was also confirmed by introducing additional robots within an episode. The proposed method enables the implementation of task allocation strategies that are feasible for different numbers of robots and various transport tasks without prior consideration of feasibility.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

However, there are a number of issues with the multi-turns conversation: The response of the chat assistant is prone to errors and cannot help users achieve their goals; It is difficult for chat assistant to generate responses with different processes based on actual needs for the same command or request; Chat assistant require the use of tools, but the current approach is not elegant and efficient, and the number of tool calls that can be supported is limited. The main reason for these issues is that large language models do not have the thinking ability as a human, lack the reasoning ability and planning ability, and lack the ability to execute plans. To solve these issues, we propose a thinking method based on a built-in chain of thought: In the multi-turns conversation, for each user prompt, the large language model thinks based on elements such as chat history, thinking context, action calls, memory and knowledge, makes detailed reasoning and planning, and actions according to the plan. We also explored how the large language model enhances thinking ability through this thinking method: Collect training datasets according to the thinking method and fine tune the large language model through supervised learning; Train a consistency reward model and use it as a reward function to fine tune the large language model using reinforcement learning, and the reinforced large language model outputs according to this way of thinking. Our experimental results show that the reasoning ability and planning ability of the large language model are enhanced, and the issues in the multi-turns conversation are solved.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing solutions often address box size variations, but overlook their intrinsic and physical properties, such as density and rigidity, which are crucial for real-world applications. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem by employing action space masking to direct the RL policy toward valid actions. Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic stability assessments which are difficult to assess in physical scenarios, our framework utilizes online learning to dynamically train the action space mask, eliminating the need for manual heuristic design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we deploy our learned task planner in a real-world robotic palletizer, validating its practical applicability in operational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Based Generic Potential Function for Policy Alignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13430v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guiding the policy of multi-agent reinforcement learning to align with human common sense is a difficult problem, largely due to the complexity of modeling common sense as a reward, especially in complex and long-horizon multi-agent tasks. Recent works have shown the effectiveness of reward shaping, such as potential-based rewards, to enhance policy alignment. The existing works, however, primarily rely on experts to design rule-based rewards, which are often labor-intensive and lack a high-level semantic understanding of common sense. To solve this problem, we propose a hierarchical vision-based reward shaping method. At the bottom layer, a visual-language model (VLM) serves as a generic potential function, guiding the policy to align with human common sense through its intrinsic semantic understanding. To help the policy adapts to uncertainty and changes in long-horizon tasks, the top layer features an adaptive skill selection module based on a visual large language model (vLLM). The module uses instructions, video replays, and training records to dynamically select suitable potential function from a pre-designed pool. Besides, our method is theoretically proven to preserve the optimal policy. Extensive experiments conducted in the Google Research Football environment demonstrate that our method not only achieves a higher win rate but also effectively aligns the policy with human common sense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Actor-Critic: Formulating Constrained Policy Iteration as Diffusion Noise Regression for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20555v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In offline reinforcement learning, it is necessary to manage out-of-distribution actions to prevent overestimation of value functions. One class of methods, the policy-regularized method, addresses this problem by constraining the target policy to stay close to the behavior policy. Although several approaches suggest representing the behavior policy as an expressive diffusion model to boost performance, it remains unclear how to regularize the target policy given a diffusion-modeled behavior sampler. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Actor-Critic (DAC) that formulates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) constraint policy iteration as a diffusion noise regression problem, enabling direct representation of target policies as diffusion models. Our approach follows the actor-critic learning paradigm in which we alternatively train a diffusion-modeled target policy and a critic network. The actor training loss includes a soft Q-guidance term from the Q-gradient. The soft Q-guidance is based on the theoretical solution of the KL constraint policy iteration, which prevents the learned policy from taking out-of-distribution actions. We demonstrate that such diffusion-based policy constraint, along with the coupling of the lower confidence bound of the Q-ensemble as value targets, not only preserves the multi-modality of target policies, but also contributes to stable convergence and strong performance in DAC. Our approach is evaluated on D4RL benchmarks and outperforms the state-of-the-art in nearly all environments. Code is available at https://github.com/Fang-Lin93/DAC.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose RLTHF, a human-AI hybrid framework that combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human annotations to achieve full-human annotation alignment with minimal effort. RLTHF identifies hard-to-annotate samples mislabeled by LLMs using a reward model's reward distribution and iteratively enhances alignment by integrating strategic human corrections while leveraging LLM's correctly labeled samples. Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that RLTHF reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort. Furthermore, models trained on RLTHF's curated datasets for downstream tasks outperform those trained on fully human-annotated datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of RLTHF's strategic data curation.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose \textsc{FLAG-Trader}, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the mobility and heterogeneity of the components such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles in multi-layer SAGIN, the challenges of inefficient resource allocation and management complexity are aggregated. To this end, the network function virtualization technology is introduced and can be implemented via service function chains (SFCs) deployment. However, urgent unexpected tasks may bring conflicts and resource competition during SFC deployment, and how to schedule the SFCs of multiple tasks in SAGIN is a key issue. In this paper, we address the dynamic and complexity of SAGIN by presenting a reconfigurable time extension graph and further propose the dynamic SFC scheduling model. Then, we formulate the SFC scheduling problem to maximize the number of successful deployed SFCs within limited resources and time horizons. Since the problem is in the form of integer linear programming and intractable to solve, we propose the algorithm by incorporating deep reinforcement learning. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better convergence and performance compared to other benchmark algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atomic Proximal Policy Optimization for Electric Robo-Taxi Dispatch and Charger Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13392v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering companies such as Waymo have deployed robo-taxi services in several U.S. cities. These robo-taxis are electric vehicles, and their operations require the joint optimization of ride matching, vehicle repositioning, and charging scheduling in a stochastic environment. We model the operations of the ride-hailing system with robo-taxis as a discrete-time, average reward Markov Decision Process with infinite horizon. As the fleet size grows, the dispatching is challenging as the set of system state and the fleet dispatching action set grow exponentially with the number of vehicles. To address this, we introduce a scalable deep reinforcement learning algorithm, called Atomic Proximal Policy Optimization (Atomic-PPO), that reduces the action space using atomic action decomposition. We evaluate our algorithm using real-world NYC for-hire vehicle data and we measure the performance using the long-run average reward achieved by the dispatching policy relative to a fluid-based reward upper bound. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our Atomic-PPO compared to benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to analyze the efficient allocation of charging facilities and assess the impact of vehicle range and charger speed on fleet performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning with Reinforced Functional Token Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13389v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose Reinforced Functional Token Tuning (RFTT), a novel reinforced fine-tuning framework that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with self-play learn-to-reason capabilities. Unlike prior prompt-driven reasoning efforts, RFTT embeds a rich set of learnable functional tokens (e.g., <analyze>, <verify>, <refine>) directly into the model vocabulary, enabling chain-of-thought construction with diverse human-like reasoning behaviors. Specifically, RFTT comprises two phases: (1) supervised fine-tuning performs prompt-driven tree search to obtain self-generated training data annotated with functional tokens, which warms up the model to learn these tokens for reasoning; and (2) online reinforcement learning further allows the model to explore different reasoning pathways through functional token sampling without relying on prompts, thereby facilitating effective self-improvement for functional reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RFTT on mathematical benchmarks, significantly boosting Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (70.6% to 79.8%) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (32.2% to 60.2%) on the MATH dataset. Moreover, the performance of RFTT consistently improves with more search rollouts at inference time. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/RFTT.</p></details> |  |

To address the problem of Large Language Model(LLM) learning in complex environments through self-reflection, we propose a Reflection of Episodes(ROE) framework based on expert experience and self-experience. This framework first obtains key information in the game through a keyframe selection method, then makes decisions based on expert experience and self-experience. After a game is completed, it reflects on the previous experience to obtain new self-experience. Finally, in the experiment, our method beat the robot under the Very Hard difficulty in TextStarCraft II. We analyze the data of the LLM in the process of the game in detail, verified its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplify RLHF as Reward-Weighted SFT: A Variational Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11026v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF has been continuously challenged by its high complexity in implementation and computation consumption. Even with recent simplifications, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Advantage Leftover Lunch (A-LoL), the problems of over-fitting and training instability remain hindering the alignment process from the expected optimal performance. To address the existing challenges, we propose a novel simplification of RLHF from the perspective of variational inference, called $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{A}$lignment with $\textbf{R}$e-weighting ($\textbf{VAR}$). More specifically, by directly minimizing the distribution gap between the learning LLM policy and the optimal solution of RLHF, we transform the alignment objective into a reward-driven re-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) form, which only requires minor adjustment on the SFT loss to obtain noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness. On comprehensive alignment and generation benchmarks, our VAR method has numerically achieved competitive performance in LLM alignment helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |

We study this problem in the context of reward machines: symbolic tasks that can be formally decomposed into sub-tasks. In order to handle settings without a priori knowledge of the environment, we introduce a framework that can learn the optimal decomposition from model-free interactions with the environment. Our method uses a task-conditioned architecture to simultaneously learn an optimal decomposition and the corresponding agents' policies for each sub-task. In doing so, we remove the need for a human to manually design the optimal decomposition while maintaining the sample-efficiency benefits of improved credit assignment. We provide experimental results in several deep reinforcement learning settings, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Our results indicate that our approach succeeds even in environments with codependent agent dynamics, enabling synchronous multi-agent learning not achievable in previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, main track full paper at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

However, the prominent approaches in prompt compression often require explicit questions or handcrafted templates for compression, limiting their generalizability. We propose Task-agnostic Prompt Compression (TPC), a novel framework that generalizes compression across tasks and domains without requiring input questions or templates. TPC generates a context-relevant task description using a task descriptor trained on a curated dataset of context and query pairs, and fine-tuned via reinforcement learning with a reward function designed to capture the most relevant information. The task descriptor is then utilized to compute the relevance of each sentence in the prompt to generate the compressed prompt. We introduce 3 model sizes (Base, Large, and Huge), where the largest model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on LongBench and ZeroSCROLLS benchmarks, and our smallest model performs comparable to the existing solutions while being considerably smaller.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter Jet Navigation and Combat using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13373v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based fighter jet agent within a customized Pygame simulation environment, designed to solve multi-objective tasks via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The jet's primary objectives include efficiently navigating the environment, reaching a target, and selectively engaging or evading an enemy. A reward function balances these goals while optimized hyperparameters enhance learning efficiency. Results show more than 80\% task completion rate, demonstrating effective decision-making. To enhance transparency, the jet's action choices are analyzed by comparing the rewards of the actual chosen action (factual action) with those of alternate actions (counterfactual actions), providing insights into the decision-making rationale. This study illustrates DRL's potential for multi-objective problem-solving with explainable AI.

The dynamic nature of video also complicates the design of multimodal models that can effectively caption these sequences. However, we find that by using minimal computational resources and without complex modifications to address video dynamics, an image-based model can be repurposed to outperform several specialised video captioning systems. Our adapted model demonstrates top tier performance on major benchmarks, ranking 2nd on MSRVTT and MSVD, and 3rd on VATEX. We transform it into a competitive video captioner by post training a typical image captioning model BLIP2 with only 6,000 video text pairs and simply concatenating frames (significantly fewer data than other methods), which use 2.5 to 144 million pairs. From a resource optimization perspective, this video captioning study focuses on three fundamental factors: optimizing model scale, maximizing data efficiency, and incorporating reinforcement learning. This extensive study demonstrates that a lightweight, image based adaptation strategy can rival state-of-the-art video captioning systems, offering a practical solution for low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025).

| **[Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Uncertainty Representations in State-Space Layers for Deep Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16824v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires reasoning about the uncertainty of the environment's hidden state. However, most reinforcement learning architectures handle partial observability with sequence models that have no internal mechanism to incorporate uncertainty in their hidden state representation, such as recurrent neural networks, deterministic state-space models and transformers. Inspired by advances in probabilistic world models for reinforcement learning, we propose a standalone Kalman filter layer that performs closed-form Gaussian inference in linear state-space models and train it end-to-end within a model-free architecture to maximize returns. Similar to efficient linear recurrent layers, the Kalman filter layer processes sequential data using a parallel scan, which scales logarithmically with the sequence length. By design, Kalman filter layers are a drop-in replacement for other recurrent layers in standard model-free architectures, but importantly they include an explicit mechanism for probabilistic filtering of the latent state representation. Experiments in a wide variety of tasks with partial observability show that Kalman filter layers excel in problems where uncertainty reasoning is key for decision-making, outperforming other stateful models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |
| **[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Gradient Sampler: Sampling as Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13280v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Value Gradient Sampler (VGS), a trainable sampler based on the interpretation of sampling as discrete-time sequential decision-making. VGS generates samples from a given unnormalized density (i.e., energy) by drifting and diffusing randomly initialized particles. In VGS, finding the optimal drift is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem where the cost is the upper bound of the KL divergence between the target density and the samples. We employ value-based dynamic programming to solve this optimal control problem, which gives the gradient of the value function as the optimal drift vector. The connection to sequential decision making allows VGS to leverage extensively studied techniques in reinforcement learning, making VGS a fast, adaptive, and accurate sampler that achieves competitive results in various sampling benchmarks. Furthermore, VGS can replace MCMC in contrastive divergence training of energy-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS in training accurate energy-based models in industrial anomaly detection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler/</p></details> |
| **[Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13248v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We propose using our score as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments in poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-Align: Aligning Vision Language Models via Retrieval-Augmented Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13146v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope and capabilities of single-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual modalities, thereby unlocking transformative cross-modal applications in a variety of real-world scenarios. Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications. We release all the code in https://github.com/taco-group/Re-Align.</p></details> | 15 pages |

In this work, we establish a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) training paradigm. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards that guide the policy to effectively respond to safety-critical events and understand real-world causal relationships. For better alignment with human driving behavior, IL is incorporated into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, especially 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented at https://hgao-cv.github.io/RAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hgao-cv.github.io/RAD</p></details> |

However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce iterative autoformalisation, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge), a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF), a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying TP-as-a-Judge and RLTPF improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Test-Time Compute Without Verification or RL is Suboptimal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12118v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial advances in scaling test-time compute, an ongoing debate in the community is how it should be scaled up to enable continued and efficient improvements with scaling. There are largely two approaches: first, distilling successful search or thinking traces; and second, using verification (e.g., 0/1 outcome rewards, reward models, or verifiers) to guide reinforcement learning (RL) and search algorithms. In this paper, we prove that finetuning LLMs with verifier-based (VB) methods based on RL or search is far superior to verifier-free (VF) approaches based on distilling or cloning search traces, given a fixed amount of compute/data budget. Further, we show that as we scale test-time compute (measured as the output token length) and training data, suboptimality of VF methods scales poorly compared to VB when the base pre-trained LLM presents a heterogeneous distribution over correct solution traces (e.g., different lengths, styles, etc.) and admits a non-sharp distribution over rewards on traces sampled from it. We formalize this condition using anti-concentration [Erd\H{o}s, 1945]. This implies a stronger result that VB methods scale better asymptotically, with the performance gap between VB and VF methods widening as test-time budget grows. We corroborate our theory empirically on both didactic and math reasoning problems with 3/8/32B-sized pre-trained LLMs, where we find verification is crucial for scaling test-time compute.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: policies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic network topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying sizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT defensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph observations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.
