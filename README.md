| **[Multimodal Mamba: Decoder-only Multimodal State Space Model via Quadratic to Linear Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13145v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face deployment challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity, growing Key-Value cache requirements, and reliance on separate vision encoders. We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

| **[Re-Align: Aligning Vision Language Models via Retrieval-Augmented Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13146v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope and capabilities of single-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual modalities, thereby unlocking transformative cross-modal applications in a variety of real-world scenarios. Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications. We release all the code in https://github.com/taco-group/Re-Align.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[UniGuardian: A Unified Defense for Detecting Prompt Injection, Backdoor Attacks and Adversarial Attacks in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13141v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection, backdoor attacks, and adversarial attacks, which manipulate prompts or models to generate harmful outputs. In this paper, departing from traditional deep learning attack paradigms, we explore their intrinsic relationship and collectively term them Prompt Trigger Attacks (PTA). This raises a key question: Can we determine if a prompt is benign or poisoned? To address this, we propose UniGuardian, the first unified defense mechanism designed to detect prompt injection, backdoor attacks, and adversarial attacks in LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a single-forward strategy to optimize the detection pipeline, enabling simultaneous attack detection and text generation within a single forward pass. Our experiments confirm that UniGuardian accurately and efficiently identifies malicious prompts in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 8 Figures, 5 Tables, Keywords: Attack Defending, Security, Prompt Injection, Backdoor Attacks, Adversarial Attacks, Prompt Trigger Attacks</p></details> |
| **[AIDE: AI-Driven Exploration in the Space of Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13138v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning, the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, has driven innovations that have fundamentally transformed the world. Yet, behind advancements lies a complex and often tedious process requiring labor and compute intensive iteration and experimentation. Engineers and scientists developing machine learning models spend much of their time on trial-and-error tasks instead of conceptualizing innovative solutions or research hypotheses. To address this challenge, we introduce AI-Driven Exploration (AIDE), a machine learning engineering agent powered by large language models (LLMs). AIDE frames machine learning engineering as a code optimization problem, and formulates trial-and-error as a tree search in the space of potential solutions. By strategically reusing and refining promising solutions, AIDE effectively trades computational resources for enhanced performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple machine learning engineering benchmarks, including our Kaggle evaluations, OpenAI MLE-Bench and METRs RE-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theorem Prover as a Judge for Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13137v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for synthetic data in mathematical reasoning has increased due to its potential to enhance the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce iterative autoformalisation, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge), a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF), a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying TP-as-a-Judge and RLTPF improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Defer for Causal Discovery with Imperfect Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13132v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating expert knowledge, e.g. from large language models, into causal discovery algorithms can be challenging when the knowledge is not guaranteed to be correct. Expert recommendations may contradict data-driven results, and their reliability can vary significantly depending on the domain or specific query. Existing methods based on soft constraints or inconsistencies in predicted causal relationships fail to account for these variations in expertise. To remedy this, we propose L2D-CD, a method for gauging the correctness of expert recommendations and optimally combining them with data-driven causal discovery results. By adapting learning-to-defer (L2D) algorithms for pairwise causal discovery (CD), we learn a deferral function that selects whether to rely on classical causal discovery methods using numerical data or expert recommendations based on textual meta-data. We evaluate L2D-CD on the canonical T\"ubingen pairs dataset and demonstrate its superior performance compared to both the causal discovery method and the expert used in isolation. Moreover, our approach identifies domains where the expert's performance is strong or weak. Finally, we outline a strategy for generalizing this approach to causal discovery on graphs with more than two variables, paving the way for further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facilitating Long Context Understanding via Supervised Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13127v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled them to process increasingly longer sequences, ranging from 2K to 2M tokens and even beyond. However, simply extending the input sequence length does not necessarily lead to effective long-context understanding. In this study, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LLMs in a supervised manner to facilitate effective long-context understanding. To achieve this, we introduce LongFinanceQA, a synthetic dataset in the financial domain designed to improve long-context reasoning. Unlike existing long-context synthetic data, LongFinanceQA includes intermediate CoT reasoning before the final conclusion, which encourages LLMs to perform explicit reasoning, improving accuracy and interpretability in long-context understanding. To generate synthetic CoT reasoning, we propose Property-driven Agentic Inference (PAI), an agentic framework that simulates human-like reasoning steps, including property extraction, retrieval, and summarization. We evaluate PAI's reasoning capabilities by assessing GPT-4o-mini w/ PAI on the Loong benchmark, outperforming standard GPT-4o-mini by 20.0%. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on LongFinanceQA, achieving a 24.6% gain on Loong's financial subset.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, 6 Tables, 8 Figures</p></details> |
| **[RuozhiBench: Evaluating LLMs with Logical Fallacies and Misleading Premises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13125v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that they can answer questions requiring complex reasoning. However, their ability to identify and respond to text containing logical fallacies or deliberately misleading premises remains less studied. To address this gap, we introduce RuozhiBench, a bilingual dataset comprising 677 carefully curated questions that contain various forms of deceptive reasoning, meticulously crafted through extensive human effort and expert review. In a comprehensive evaluation of 17 LLMs from 5 Series over RuozhiBench using both open-ended and two-choice formats, we conduct extensive analyses on evaluation protocols and result patterns. Despite their high scores on conventional benchmarks, these models showed limited ability to detect and reason correctly about logical fallacies, with even the best-performing model, Claude-3-haiku, achieving only 62% accuracy compared to the human of more than 90%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Psycholinguistic Research for LLMs: Gender-inclusive Language in a Coreference Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13120v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gender-inclusive language is often used with the aim of ensuring that all individuals, regardless of gender, can be associated with certain concepts. While psycholinguistic studies have examined its effects in relation to human cognition, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) process gender-inclusive language. Given that commercial LLMs are gaining an increasingly strong foothold in everyday applications, it is crucial to examine whether LLMs in fact interpret gender-inclusive language neutrally, because the language they generate has the potential to influence the language of their users. This study examines whether LLM-generated coreferent terms align with a given gender expression or reflect model biases. Adapting psycholinguistic methods from French to English and German, we find that in English, LLMs generally maintain the antecedent's gender but exhibit underlying masculine bias. In German, this bias is much stronger, overriding all tested gender-neutralization strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ACL 2025 (ARR February 2025 cycle)</p></details> |
| **[STEER-ME: Assessing the Microeconomic Reasoning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13119v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How should one judge whether a given large language model (LLM) can reliably perform economic reasoning? Most existing LLM benchmarks focus on specific applications and fail to present the model with a rich variety of economic tasks. A notable exception is Raman et al. [2024], who offer an approach for comprehensively benchmarking strategic decision-making; however, this approach fails to address the non-strategic settings prevalent in microeconomics, such as supply-and-demand analysis. We address this gap by taxonomizing microeconomic reasoning into $58$ distinct elements, focusing on the logic of supply and demand, each grounded in up to $10$ distinct domains, $5$ perspectives, and $3$ types. The generation of benchmark data across this combinatorial space is powered by a novel LLM-assisted data generation protocol that we dub auto-STEER, which generates a set of questions by adapting handwritten templates to target new domains and perspectives. Because it offers an automated way of generating fresh questions, auto-STEER mitigates the risk that LLMs will be trained to over-fit evaluation benchmarks; we thus hope that it will serve as a useful tool both for evaluating and fine-tuning models for years to come. We demonstrate the usefulness of our benchmark via a case study on $27$ LLMs, ranging from small open-source models to the current state of the art. We examined each model's ability to solve microeconomic problems across our whole taxonomy and present the results across a range of prompting strategies and scoring metrics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models in Statistical Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13117v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The programming capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized automatic code generation and opened new avenues for automatic statistical analysis. However, the validity and quality of these generated codes need to be systematically evaluated before they can be widely adopted. Despite their growing prominence, a comprehensive evaluation of statistical code generated by LLMs remains scarce in the literature. In this paper, we assess the performance of LLMs, including two versions of ChatGPT and one version of Llama, in the domain of SAS programming for statistical analysis. Our study utilizes a set of statistical analysis tasks encompassing diverse statistical topics and datasets. Each task includes a problem description, dataset information, and human-verified SAS code. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the quality of SAS code generated by LLMs through human expert evaluation based on correctness, effectiveness, readability, executability, and the accuracy of output results. The analysis of rating scores reveals that while LLMs demonstrate usefulness in generating syntactically correct code, they struggle with tasks requiring deep domain understanding and may produce redundant or incorrect results. This study offers valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in statistical programming, providing guidance for future advancements in AI-assisted coding systems for statistical analysis.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Multilingual Retrieval Augmented Generation for Culturally-Sensitive Tasks: A Benchmark for Cross-lingual Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01171v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paradigm of retrieval-augmented generated (RAG) helps mitigate hallucinations of large language models (LLMs). However, RAG also introduces biases contained within the retrieved documents. These biases can be amplified in scenarios which are multilingual and culturally-sensitive, such as territorial disputes. In this paper, we introduce BordIRLines, a benchmark consisting of 720 territorial dispute queries paired with 14k Wikipedia documents across 49 languages. To evaluate LLMs' cross-lingual robustness for this task, we formalize several modes for multilingual retrieval. Our experiments on several LLMs reveal that retrieving multilingual documents best improves response consistency and decreases geopolitical bias over using purely in-language documents, showing how incorporating diverse perspectives improves robustness. Also, querying in low-resource languages displays a much wider variance in the linguistic distribution of response citations. Our further experiments and case studies investigate how cross-lingual RAG is affected by aspects from IR to document contents. We release our benchmark and code to support further research towards ensuring equitable information access across languages at https://huggingface.co/datasets/borderlines/bordirlines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatterChat: A Multi-Modal LLM for Material Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13107v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the properties of inorganic materials is crucial for accelerating advancements in materials science and driving applications in energy, electronics, and beyond. Integrating material structure data with language-based information through multi-modal large language models (LLMs) offers great potential to support these efforts by enhancing human-AI interaction. However, a key challenge lies in integrating atomic structures at full resolution into LLMs. In this work, we introduce MatterChat, a versatile structure-aware multi-modal LLM that unifies material structural data and textual inputs into a single cohesive model. MatterChat employs a bridging module to effectively align a pretrained machine learning interatomic potential with a pretrained LLM, reducing training costs and enhancing flexibility. Our results demonstrate that MatterChat significantly improves performance in material property prediction and human-AI interaction, surpassing general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4. We also demonstrate its usefulness in applications such as more advanced scientific reasoning and step-by-step material synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can a Single Model Master Both Multi-turn Conversations and Tool Use? CoALM: A Unified Conversational Agentic Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08820v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with API-calling capabilities enabled building effective Language Agents (LA), while also revolutionizing the conventional task-oriented dialogue (TOD) paradigm. However, current approaches face a critical dilemma: TOD systems are often trained on a limited set of target APIs, requiring new data to maintain their quality when interfacing with new services, while LAs are not trained to maintain user intent over multi-turn conversations. Because both robust multi-turn management and advanced function calling are crucial for effective conversational agents, we evaluate these skills on three popular benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 (TOD), BFCL V3 (LA), and API-Bank (LA), and our analyses reveal that specialized approaches excel in one domain but underperform in the other. To bridge this chasm, we introduce CoALM (Conversational Agentic Language Model), a unified approach that integrates both conversational and agentic capabilities. We created CoALM-IT, a carefully constructed multi-task dataset that interleave multi-turn ReAct reasoning with complex API usage. Using CoALM-IT, we train three models CoALM 8B, CoALM 70B, and CoALM 405B, which outperform top domain-specific models, including GPT-4o, across all three benchmarks.This demonstrates the feasibility of a single model approach for both TOD and LA, setting a new standard for conversational agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2World: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Symbolic World Model Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13092v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.

| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted outputs, posing a serious threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This disrupts the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the "unsafe" prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Fake News Detection With Large Language Model via Defense Among Competing Wisdom](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03371v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most fake news detection methods learn latent feature representations based on neural networks, which makes them black boxes to classify a piece of news without giving any justification. Existing explainable systems generate veracity justifications from investigative journalism, which suffer from debunking delayed and low efficiency. Recent studies simply assume that the justification is equivalent to the majority opinions expressed in the wisdom of crowds. However, the opinions typically contain some inaccurate or biased information since the wisdom of crowds is uncensored. To detect fake news from a sea of diverse, crowded and even competing narratives, in this paper, we propose a novel defense-based explainable fake news detection framework. Specifically, we first propose an evidence extraction module to split the wisdom of crowds into two competing parties and respectively detect salient evidences. To gain concise insights from evidences, we then design a prompt-based module that utilizes a large language model to generate justifications by inferring reasons towards two possible veracities. Finally, we propose a defense-based inference module to determine veracity via modeling the defense among these justifications. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fake news detection and provides high-quality justifications.</p></details> | 12 pages, WWW'2024 |

These causal relationships are often represented by causal graphs, which are directed acyclic graphs. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing interest in exploring their capabilities in causal reasoning and their potential use to hypothesize causal graphs. These tasks necessitate the LLMs to encode the causal graph effectively for subsequent downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce CausalGraph2LLM, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 700k queries across diverse causal graph settings to evaluate the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We categorize the causal queries into two types: graph-level and node-level queries. We benchmark both open-sourced and propriety models for our study. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise in this domain, they are highly sensitive to the encoding used. Even capable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with deviations of about $60\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for downstream causal intervention tasks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs can often display biases when presented with contextual information about a causal graph, potentially stemming from their parametric memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL'25 Findings, Code - https://github.com/ivaxi0s/CausalGraph2LLM</p></details> |

However, traditional performance metrics like Mean Squared Error and L0 sparsity ignore the evaluation of the semantic representational power of SAEs -- whether they can acquire interpretable monosemantic features while preserving the semantic relationship of words. For instance, it is not obvious whether a learned sparse feature could distinguish different meanings in one word. In this paper, we propose a suite of evaluations for SAEs to analyze the quality of monosemantic features by focusing on polysemous words. Our findings reveal that SAEs developed to improve the MSE-L0 Pareto frontier may confuse interpretability, which does not necessarily enhance the extraction of monosemantic features. The analysis of SAEs with polysemous words can also figure out the internal mechanism of LLMs; deeper layers and the Attention module contribute to distinguishing polysemy in a word. Our semantics focused evaluation offers new insights into the polysemy and the existing SAE objective and contributes to the development of more practical SAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce SimpleVQA, the first comprehensive multi-modal benchmark to evaluate the factuality ability of MLLMs to answer natural language short questions. SimpleVQA is characterized by six key features: it covers multiple tasks and multiple scenarios, ensures high quality and challenging queries, maintains static and timeless reference answers, and is straightforward to evaluate. Our approach involves categorizing visual question-answering items into 9 different tasks around objective events or common knowledge and situating these within 9 topics. Rigorous quality control processes are implemented to guarantee high-quality, concise, and clear answers, facilitating evaluation with minimal variance via an LLM-as-a-judge scoring system. Using SimpleVQA, we perform a comprehensive assessment of leading 18 MLLMs and 8 text-only LLMs, delving into their image comprehension and text generation abilities by identifying and analyzing error cases.</p></details> |  |

Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier. Evaluation in real-world settings demonstrates LAMD's effectiveness over conventional detectors, establishing a feasible basis for LLM-driven malware analysis in dynamic threat landscapes.</p></details> |  |

Prompting Large Language Models for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13044v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect sentiment quadruple prediction (ASQP) facilitates a detailed understanding of opinions expressed in a text by identifying the opinion term, aspect term, aspect category and sentiment polarity for each opinion. However, annotating a full set of training examples to fine-tune models for ASQP is a resource-intensive process. In this study, we explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for zero- and few-shot learning on the ASQP task across five diverse datasets. We report F1 scores slightly below those obtained with state-of-the-art fine-tuned models but exceeding previously reported zero- and few-shot performance. In the 40-shot setting on the Rest16 restaurant domain dataset, LLMs achieved an F1 score of 52.46, compared to 60.39 by the best-performing fine-tuned method MVP. Additionally, we report the performance of LLMs in target aspect sentiment detection (TASD), where the F1 scores were also close to fine-tuned models, achieving 66.03 on Rest16 in the 40-shot setting, compared to 72.76 with MVP. While human annotators remain essential for achieving optimal performance, LLMs can reduce the need for extensive manual annotation in ASQP tasks.</p></details> |  |

They allow users to perform intuitive and precise editing to achieve desired visual appearances. However, creating a procedural material given an input image requires professional knowledge and significant effort. In this work, we leverage the ability to convert procedural materials into standard Python programs and fine-tune a large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate such programs from input images. To enable effective fine-tuning, we also contribute an open-source procedural material dataset and propose to perform program-level augmentation by prompting another pre-trained large language model (LLM). Through extensive evaluation, we show that our method outperforms previous methods on both synthetic and real-world examples.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Spotlight |
| **[Thoughts Are All Over the Place: On the Underthinking of o1-Like LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18585v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and exhibiting human-like deep thinking. However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path.

| **[HPSS: Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search for LLM Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13031v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the adoption of large language models (LLMs) for text evaluation has become increasingly prevalent in the field of natural language processing (NLP), a series of existing works attempt to optimize the prompts for LLM evaluators to improve their alignment with human judgment. However, their efforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts, such as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the evaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting strategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To this end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and propose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm, HPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for LLM evaluators. A heuristic function is employed to guide the search process, enhancing the performance of our algorithm. Extensive experiments across four evaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently outperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic prompt optimization methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13025v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our analysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub' concepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for open-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific discovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Human Understanding of Paraphrase Types in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02302v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paraphrases represent a human's intuitive ability to understand expressions presented in various different ways. Current paraphrase evaluations of language models primarily use binary approaches, offering limited interpretability of specific text changes. Atomic paraphrase types (APT) decompose paraphrases into different linguistic changes and offer a granular view of the flexibility in linguistic expression (e.g., a shift in syntax or vocabulary used). In this study, we assess the human preferences towards ChatGPT in generating English paraphrases with ten APTs and five prompting techniques. We introduce APTY (Atomic Paraphrase TYpes), a dataset of 800 sentence-level and word-level annotations by 15 annotators. The dataset also provides a human preference ranking of paraphrases with different types that can be used to fine-tune models with RLHF and DPO methods. Our results reveal that ChatGPT and a DPO-trained LLama 7B model can generate simple APTs, such as additions and deletions, but struggle with complex structures (e.g., subordination changes). This study contributes to understanding which aspects of paraphrasing language models have already succeeded at understanding and what remains elusive. In addition, we show how our curated datasets can be used to develop language models with specific linguistic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oreo: A Plug-in Context Reconstructor to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13019v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various NLP tasks, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations due to their limited parametric knowledge and lack of domain-specific expertise. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by incorporating external document retrieval to augment the knowledge base of LLMs. In this approach, RAG retrieves document chunks from an external corpus in response to a query, which are then used as context for the downstream language model to generate an answer. However, these retrieved knowledge sources often include irrelevant or erroneous information, undermining the effectiveness of RAG in downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a compact, efficient, and pluggable module designed to refine external knowledge sources before feeding them to the generator. The module reconstructs retrieved content by extracting the most relevant and supportive information and reorganising it into a concise, query-specific format. Through a three-stage training paradigm - comprising supervised fine-tuning, contrastive multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning-based alignment - it prioritises critical knowledge and aligns it with the generator's preferences. This method enables LLMs to produce outputs that are more accurate, reliable, and contextually appropriate.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, evaluating RPAs is challenging due to diverse task requirements and agent designs. This paper proposes an evidence-based, actionable, and generalizable evaluation design guideline for LLM-based RPA by systematically reviewing 1,676 papers published between Jan. 2021 and Dec. 2024. Our analysis identifies six agent attributes, seven task attributes, and seven evaluation metrics from existing literature. Based on these findings, we present an RPA evaluation design guideline to help researchers develop more systematic and consistent evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Knowledge Graphs Enhance Medical Question Answering: Bridging the Gap Between LLMs and Evolving Medical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13010v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Adaptive Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries. Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[You need to MIMIC to get FAME: Solving Meeting Transcript Scarcity with a Multi-Agent Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13001v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meeting summarization suffers from limited high-quality data, mainly due to privacy restrictions and expensive collection processes. We address this gap with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer information-oriented difficulty (4/5 in difficulty). These findings highlight that FAME is a good and scalable proxy for real-world meeting conditions. It enables new test scenarios for meeting summarization research and other conversation-centric applications in tasks requiring conversation data or simulating social scenarios under behavioral constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Top-k Set Queries Over Predicted Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12998v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the applicability of expensive external oracles such as large language models in answering top-k queries over predicted scores. Such scores are incurred by user-defined functions to answer personalized queries over multi-modal data. We propose a generic computational framework that handles arbitrary set-based scoring functions, as long as the functions could be decomposed into constructs, each of which sent to an oracle (in our case an LLM) to predict partial scores. At a given point in time, the framework assumes a set of responses and their partial predicted scores, and it maintains a collection of possible sets that are likely to be the true top-k. Since calling oracles is costly, our framework judiciously identifies the next construct, i.e., the next best question to ask the oracle so as to maximize the likelihood of identifying the true top-k. We present a principled probabilistic model that quantifies that likelihood. We study efficiency opportunities in designing algorithms. We run an evaluation with three large scale datasets, scoring functions, and baselines. Experiments indicate the efficacy of our framework, as it achieves an order of magnitude improvement over baselines in requiring LLM calls while ensuring result accuracy. Scalability experiments further indicate that our framework could be used in large-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Profile: From Surface-Level Facts to Deep Persona Simulation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12988v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous approaches to persona simulation large language models (LLMs) have typically relied on learning basic biographical information, or using limited role-play dialogue datasets to capture a character's responses. However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought processes of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. We hope that this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLM.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Large Language Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs. Project page and codes: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural-Symbolic Collaborative Distillation: Advancing Small Language Models for Complex Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13203v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose $\textbf{Ne}$ural-$\textbf{Sy}$mbolic $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{D}$istillation ($\textbf{NesyCD}$), a novel knowledge distillation method for learning the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., \textgreater 13B). We argue that complex reasoning tasks are difficult for Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 7B), as these tasks demand not only general cognitive abilities but also specialized knowledge, which is often sparse and difficult for these neural-based SLMs to effectively capture. Therefore, NesyCD distills the general capabilities and specialized knowledge in LLMs using different manners. On the one hand, we distill only general abilities from teacher LLMs into the student SLMs of parameterized neural networks. On the other hand, for the specialized abilities and uncommon knowledge of a complex reasoning task, we employ a symbolic knowledge distillation approach to obtain and store the specialized knowledge within a symbolic knowledge base (KB). By decoupling general and specialized capabilities, the proposed NesyCD can achieve superior performance cost-effectively, utilizing smaller models and blending parameterized neural networks with symbolic KB. Moreover, the specialized KB generalizes well and is comprehended and manipulated by humans. Our experiments show that NesyCD significantly boosts SLMs' complex reasoning performance on in-domain (BBH, GSM8K) and out-of-domain (AGIEval, ARC) datasets. Notably, our approach enabled the LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B to surpass GPT-3.5-turbo in performance and come close to matching LLaMA3-70B, despite the latter having nine times more parameters. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/NesyCD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

These LLM-based dense retrievers have shown promising performance across various retrieval scenarios. However, relying on a single embedding to represent documents proves less effective in capturing different perspectives of documents for matching. In this paper, we propose Deliberate Thinking based Dense Retriever (DEBATER), which enhances these LLM-based retrievers by enabling them to learn more effective document representations through a step-by-step thinking process. DEBATER introduces the Chain-of-Deliberation mechanism to iteratively optimize document representations using a continuous chain of thought. To consolidate information from various thinking steps, DEBATER also incorporates the Self Distillation mechanism, which identifies the most informative thinking steps and integrates them into a unified text embedding. Experimental results show that DEBATER significantly outperforms existing methods across several retrieval benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. All codes are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/DEBATER.</p></details> |  |

However, IFT still relies heavily on instance training of extensive task data, which greatly limits the adaptability of LLMs to real-world scenarios where labeled task instances are scarce and broader task generalization becomes paramount. Contrary to LLMs, humans acquire skills and complete tasks not merely through repeated practice but also by understanding and following instructional guidelines. This paper is dedicated to simulating human learning to address the shortcomings of instance training, focusing on instruction learning to enhance cross-task generalization. Within this context, we introduce Task Adapters Generation from Instructions (TAGI), which automatically constructs the task-specific model in a parameter generation manner based on the given task instructions without retraining for unseen tasks. Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the consistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and task-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the labels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed with cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training process that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning. We evaluate TAGI on the Super-Natural Instructions and P3 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TAGI can match or even outperform traditional meta-trained models and other hypernetwork models, while significantly reducing computational requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We argue that it is important to distinguish between two types of hallucinations: ones where the model does not hold the correct answer in its parameters, which we term HK-, and ones where the model answers incorrectly despite having the required knowledge, termed HK+. We first find that HK+ hallucinations are prevalent and occur across models and datasets. Then, we demonstrate that distinguishing between these two cases is beneficial for mitigating hallucinations. Importantly, we show that different models hallucinate on different examples, which motivates constructing model-specific hallucination datasets for training detectors. Overall, our findings draw attention to classifying types of hallucinations and provide means to handle them more effectively.

However, leveraging these reasoning capabilities to enhance LLM safety against adversarial attacks and jailbreak queries remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-to-Defend (R2D), a novel training paradigm that integrates safety reflections of queries and responses into LLMs' generation process, unlocking a safety-aware reasoning mechanism. This approach enables self-evaluation at each reasoning step to create safety pivot tokens as indicators of the response's safety status. Furthermore, in order to improve the learning efficiency of pivot token prediction, we propose Contrastive Pivot Optimization(CPO), which enhances the model's ability to perceive the safety status of dialogues. Through this mechanism, LLMs dynamically adjust their response strategies during reasoning, significantly enhancing their defense capabilities against jailbreak attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that R2D effectively mitigates various attacks and improves overall safety, highlighting the substantial potential of safety-aware reasoning in strengthening LLMs' robustness against jailbreaks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Prior research has associated hallucinations with model uncertainty, leveraging this relationship for hallucination detection and mitigation. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that all hallucinations are associated with uncertainty. Using knowledge detection and uncertainty measurement methods, we demonstrate that models can hallucinate with high certainty even when they have the correct knowledge. We further show that high-certainty hallucinations are consistent across models and datasets, distinctive enough to be singled out, and challenge existing mitigation methods. Our findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety. The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/Trust_me_Im_wrong .</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite Retrieval: Attention Enhanced LLMs in Long-Context Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12962v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited by the context window size of Large Language Models(LLMs), handling various tasks with input tokens exceeding the upper limit has been challenging, whether it is a simple direct retrieval task or a complex multi-hop reasoning task. Although various methods have been proposed to enhance the long-context processing capabilities of LLMs, they either incur substantial post-training costs, or require additional tool modules(e.g.,RAG), or have not shown significant improvement in realistic tasks. Our work observes the correlation between the attention distribution and generated answers across each layer, and establishes the attention allocation aligns with retrieval-augmented capabilities through experiments. Drawing on the above insights, we propose a novel method InfiniRetri that leverages the LLMs's own attention information to enable accurate retrieval across inputs of infinitely length. Our evaluations indicate that InfiniRetri achieves 100% accuracy in the Needle-In-a-Haystack(NIH) test over 1M tokens using a 0.5B parameter model, surpassing other method or larger models and setting a new state-of-the-art(SOTA). Moreover, our method achieves significant performance improvements on real-world benchmarks, with a maximum 288% improvement. In addition, InfiniRetri can be applied to any Transformer-based LLMs without additional training and substantially reduces inference latency and compute overhead in long texts. In summary, our comprehensive studies show InfiniRetri's potential for practical applications and creates a paradigm for retrievaling information using LLMs own capabilities under infinite-length tokens. Code will be released in link.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Adaptive Tool Use in Large Language Models with Meta-Cognition Trigger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12961v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities, transforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for complex problems that require specialized processing or real-time data. While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, weather/map apps), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues:(1) increased delays due to unnecessary tool calls, and (2) potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, representing the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Our experiments show that MeCo accurately detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making across multiple base models and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance.</p></details> |  |

However, their high memory requirements prevent their use in resource-constrained environments. While knowledge distillation (KD) has been a proven method for model compression, its application to MoE teacher models remains underexplored. Through our investigation, we discover that non-activated experts in MoE models possess valuable knowledge that benefits student models. We further demonstrate that existing KD methods are not optimal for compressing MoE models, as they fail to leverage this knowledge effectively. To address this, we propose two intuitive MoE-specific KD methods for the first time: Knowledge Augmentation (KA) and Student-Aware Router (SAR), both designed to effectively extract knowledge from all experts. Specifically, KA augments knowledge by sampling experts multiple times, while SAR uses all experts and adjusts the expert weights through router training to provide optimal knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our methods outperform conventional KD methods, demonstrating their effectiveness for MoE teacher models.</p></details> |  |

The rise of high-quality AI-generated content has spurred interest in AI-driven micro-video creation. However, despite the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in text generation and reasoning, their potential to assist the creation of popular micro-videos remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content. Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation. This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities. We will release the code and datasets to support future studies.</p></details> |  |

Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12509v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, but their stochastic nature poses challenges to the reliability of their outputs. While deterministic settings can improve consistency, they do not guarantee reliability, as a single sample from the model's probability distribution can still be misleading. Building upon the concept of LLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the reliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the reliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard single-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact of temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the limitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple samples, which we show has significant implications for downstream applications. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on single-shot evaluations. This work provides a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and reliable LLM-based systems and applications.</p></details> |  |

FoO enables LLMs to systematically explore a diverse range of possibilities in their reasoning, as demonstrated by an FoO-based agentic system for autonomously solving Machine Learning tasks (AutoML).

With an overall operation cost under $1 per task, our framework is well-suited for cost-sensitive applications. Beyond classification and regression, we illustrate the broader applicability of our FoO-based agentic system to tasks such as reinforcement learning and image generation. Our framework presents significant advancements compared to current state-of-the-art agentic systems for AutoML, due to the benefits of FoO in enforcing diversity in LLM solutions through compressed, explainable representations that also support long-term memory when combined with case-based reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github code: https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Options</p></details> |

However, dense models usually suffer from sparse activation, where many activation values tend towards zero (i.e., being inactivated). We argue that this could restrict the efficient exploration of model representation space. To mitigate this issue, we propose Finedeep, a deep-layered fine-grained expert architecture for dense models. Our framework partitions the feed-forward neural network layers of traditional dense models into small experts, arranges them across multiple sub-layers. A novel routing mechanism is proposed to determine each expert's contribution. We conduct extensive experiments across various model sizes, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms traditional dense architectures in terms of perplexity and benchmark performance while maintaining a comparable number of parameters and floating-point operations. Moreover, we find that Finedeep achieves optimal results when balancing depth and width, specifically by adjusting the number of expert sub-layers and the number of experts per sub-layer.

We introduce Synthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a novel framework designed to deliver immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive, real-world student data. In SEFL, two large language models (LLMs) operate in teacher--student roles to simulate assignment completion and formative feedback, generating abundant synthetic pairs of student work and corresponding critiques. We then fine-tune smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs on these synthetic pairs, enabling them to replicate key features of high-quality, goal-oriented feedback. Unlike personalized tutoring approaches that offer multi-turn, individualized instruction, SEFL specifically focuses on replicating the teacher-->student feedback loop for diverse assignments. Through both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations, we demonstrate that SEFL-tuned models outperform their non-tuned counterparts in feedback quality, clarity, and timeliness. These findings reveal SEFL's potential to transform feedback processes for higher education and beyond, offering an ethical and scalable alternative to conventional manual feedback cycles.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications. We release all the code in https://github.com/taco-group/Re-Align.</p></details> | 15 pages |

In this work, we establish a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) training paradigm. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards that guide the policy to effectively respond to safety-critical events and understand real-world causal relationships. For better alignment with human driving behavior, IL is incorporated into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, especially 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented at https://hgao-cv.github.io/RAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hgao-cv.github.io/RAD</p></details> |
| **[Theorem Prover as a Judge for Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13137v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for synthetic data in mathematical reasoning has increased due to its potential to enhance the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce iterative autoformalisation, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge), a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF), a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying TP-as-a-Judge and RLTPF improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Test-Time Compute Without Verification or RL is Suboptimal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12118v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial advances in scaling test-time compute, an ongoing debate in the community is how it should be scaled up to enable continued and efficient improvements with scaling. There are largely two approaches: first, distilling successful search or thinking traces; and second, using verification (e.g., 0/1 outcome rewards, reward models, or verifiers) to guide reinforcement learning (RL) and search algorithms. In this paper, we prove that finetuning LLMs with verifier-based (VB) methods based on RL or search is far superior to verifier-free (VF) approaches based on distilling or cloning search traces, given a fixed amount of compute/data budget. Further, we show that as we scale test-time compute (measured as the output token length) and training data, suboptimality of VF methods scales poorly compared to VB when the base pre-trained LLM presents a heterogeneous distribution over correct solution traces (e.g., different lengths, styles, etc.) and admits a non-sharp distribution over rewards on traces sampled from it. We formalize this condition using anti-concentration [Erd\H{o}s, 1945]. This implies a stronger result that VB methods scale better asymptotically, with the performance gap between VB and VF methods widening as test-time budget grows. We corroborate our theory empirically on both didactic and math reasoning problems with 3/8/32B-sized pre-trained LLMs, where we find verification is crucial for scaling test-time compute.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent and adaptive cyber defense systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: policies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic network topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying sizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT defensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph observations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.

A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Additionally, we explore K-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, focusing on their methodologies and regret analyses. We also examine the connections between SCAB problems and functional data analysis.

To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks.

| **[Correcting the Mythos of KL-Regularization: Direct Alignment without Overoptimization via Chi-Squared Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13399v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have led to impressive advances in language model capabilities, but are limited by a widely observed phenomenon known as overoptimization, where the quality of the language model degrades over the course of the alignment process. As the model optimizes performance with respect to an offline reward model, it overfits to inaccuracies and drifts away from preferred responses covered by the data. To discourage such distribution shift, KL-regularization is widely employed in existing offline alignment methods, but overoptimization continues to harm performance. Lending theoretical insight into the source of these empirical observations, we first show that the KL-regularization is too weak to prevent overfitting, then raise the following question: is it possible to design an efficient algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization? We address this question with a new algorithm for offline alignment, $\chi^2$-Preference Optimization ($\chi$PO). $\chi$PO is a one-line change to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023), which only involves modifying the logarithmic link function in the DPO objective. Despite this minimal change, $\chi$PO implicitly implements the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via regularization with the $\chi^2$-divergence -- which quantifies uncertainty more effectively than KL-regularization -- and provably alleviates overoptimization, achieving sample-complexity guarantees based on single-policy concentrability -- the gold standard in offline reinforcement learning. $\chi$PO's simplicity and strong guarantees make it the first practical and general-purpose offline alignment algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Paradigm in Tuning Learned Indexes: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05001v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned Index Structures (LIS) have significantly advanced data management by leveraging machine learning models to optimize data indexing. However, designing these structures often involves critical trade-offs, making it challenging for both designers and end-users to find an optimal balance tailored to specific workloads and scenarios. While some indexes offer adjustable parameters that demand intensive manual tuning, others rely on fixed configurations based on heuristic auto-tuners or expert knowledge, which may not consistently deliver optimal performance. This paper introduces LITune, a novel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures. LITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To accommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance LITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These innovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online tuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and workloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in runtime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter settings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight LITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS in real-world applications.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Approach to Robotic Manipulation with VLM-Generated Iterative Keypoint Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08643v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task specification for robotic manipulation in open-world environments is challenging, requiring flexible and adaptive objectives that align with human intentions and can evolve through iterative feedback. We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Project Page: https://iker-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Oreo: A Plug-in Context Reconstructor to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13019v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various NLP tasks, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations due to their limited parametric knowledge and lack of domain-specific expertise. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by incorporating external document retrieval to augment the knowledge base of LLMs. In this approach, RAG retrieves document chunks from an external corpus in response to a query, which are then used as context for the downstream language model to generate an answer. However, these retrieved knowledge sources often include irrelevant or erroneous information, undermining the effectiveness of RAG in downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a compact, efficient, and pluggable module designed to refine external knowledge sources before feeding them to the generator. The module reconstructs retrieved content by extracting the most relevant and supportive information and reorganising it into a concise, query-specific format. Through a three-stage training paradigm - comprising supervised fine-tuning, contrastive multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning-based alignment - it prioritises critical knowledge and aligns it with the generator's preferences. This method enables LLMs to produce outputs that are more accurate, reliable, and contextually appropriate.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[HOMIE: Humanoid Loco-Manipulation with Isomorphic Exoskeleton Cockpit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13013v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current humanoid teleoperation systems either lack reliable low-level control policies, or struggle to acquire accurate whole-body control commands, making it difficult to teleoperate humanoids for loco-manipulation tasks. To solve these issues, we propose HOMIE, a novel humanoid teleoperation cockpit integrates a humanoid loco-manipulation policy and a low-cost exoskeleton-based hardware system. The policy enables humanoid robots to walk and squat to specific heights while accommodating arbitrary upper-body poses. This is achieved through our novel reinforcement learning-based training framework that incorporates upper-body pose curriculum, height-tracking reward, and symmetry utilization, without relying on any motion priors. Complementing the policy, the hardware system integrates isomorphic exoskeleton arms, a pair of motion-sensing gloves, and a pedal, allowing a single operator to achieve full control of the humanoid robot. Our experiments show our cockpit facilitates more stable, rapid, and precise humanoid loco-manipulation teleoperation, accelerating task completion and eliminating retargeting errors compared to inverse kinematics-based methods. We also validate the effectiveness of the data collected by our cockpit for imitation learning. Our project is fully open-sourced, demos and code can be found in https://homietele.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Obtaining such a domain model is notoriously hard. Algorithms for learning domain models exist, yet it remains unclear whether learning a domain model and planning is an effective approach for numeric planning environments, i.e., where states include discrete and numeric state variables. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning a numeric domain model and compare it with alternative model-free solutions. As a case study, we use two tasks in Minecraft, a popular sandbox game that has been used as an AI challenge. First, we consider an offline learning setting, where a set of expert trajectories are available to learn from. This is the standard setting for learning domain models. We used the Numeric Safe Action Model Learning (NSAM) algorithm to learn a numeric domain model and solve new problems with the learned domain model and a numeric planner. We call this model-based solution NSAM_(+p), and compare it to several model-free Imitation Learning (IL) and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Empirical results show that some IL algorithms can learn faster to solve simple tasks, while NSAM_(+p) allows solving tasks that require long-term planning and enables generalizing to solve problems in larger environments. Then, we consider an online learning setting, where learning is done by moving an agent in the environment. For this setting, we introduce RAMP. In RAMP, observations collected during the agent's execution are used to simultaneously train an RL policy and learn a planning domain action model. This forms a positive feedback loop between the RL policy and the learned domain model. We demonstrate experimentally the benefits of using RAMP, showing that it finds more efficient plans and solves more problems than several RL baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for On-Demand Urban Mobility Problem on a Large Map (extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01534v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the autonomous multiagent taxi routing problem for a large urban environment where the location and number of future ride requests are unknown a-priori, but can be estimated by an empirical distribution. Recent theory has shown that a rollout algorithm with a stable base policy produces a near-optimal stable policy. In the routing setting, a policy is stable if its execution keeps the number of outstanding requests uniformly bounded over time. Although, rollout-based approaches are well-suited for learning cooperative multiagent policies with considerations for future demand, applying such methods to a large urban environment can be computationally expensive due to the large number of taxis required for stability. In this paper, we aim to address the computational bottleneck of multiagent rollout by proposing an approximate multiagent rollout-based two phase algorithm that reduces computational costs, while still achieving a stable near-optimal policy. Our approach partitions the graph into sectors based on the predicted demand and the maximum number of taxis that can run sequentially given the user's computational resources. The algorithm then applies instantaneous assignment (IA) for re-balancing taxis across sectors and a sector-wide multiagent rollout algorithm that is executed in parallel for each sector. We provide two main theoretical results: 1) characterize the number of taxis $m$ that is sufficient for IA to be stable; 2) derive a necessary condition on $m$ to maintain stability for IA as time goes to infinity. Our numerical results show that our approach achieves stability for an $m$ that satisfies the theoretical conditions. We also empirically demonstrate that our proposed two phase algorithm has equivalent performance to the one-at-a-time rollout over the entire map, but with significantly lower runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 1 lemma, and 2 theorems</p></details> |

It is known that variations in input domains (e.g., different panorama colors due to seasonal changes) or task domains (e.g., altering the target speed of a car) can disrupt agent performance, necessitating new training for each variation. Recent advancements in the field of representation learning have demonstrated the possibility of combining components from different neural networks to create new models in a zero-shot fashion. In this paper, we build upon relative representations, a framework that maps encoder embeddings to a universal space. We adapt this framework to the Visual Reinforcement Learning setting, allowing to combine agents components to create new agents capable of effectively handling novel visual-task pairs not encountered during training. Our findings highlight the potential for model reuse, significantly reducing the need for retraining and, consequently, the time and computational resources required.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</p></details> |  |

Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

However, UAV networks pose significant challenges due to their dynamic and distributed nature, particularly when dealing with tasks such as power allocation, channel assignment, caching,and task offloading. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle to handle the complexity and unpredictability of these environments, leading to suboptimal performance. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be applied to solve these mathematical optimization problems in UAV communications and networking.Rather than simply introducing DRL methods, the focus is on demonstrating how these methods can be utilized to solve complex mathematical models of the underlying problems. We begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of DRL, including value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic approaches. Then,we illustrate how DRL algorithms are applied to specific UAV network tasks by discussing from problem formulations to DRL implementation. By framing UAV communication challenges as optimization problems, this survey emphasizes the practical value of DRL in dynamic and uncertain environments. We also explore the strengths of DRL in handling large-scale network scenarios and the ability to continuously adapt to changes in the environment. In addition, future research directions are outlined, highlighting the potential for DRL to further enhance UAV communications and expand its applicability to more complex,multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |

Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately translating verbal commands into physical actions is promising, but still presents challenges. Current approaches require large datasets to train the models and are limited to robots with a maximum of 6 degrees of freedom. To address these issues, we propose a framework called InstructRobot that maps natural language instructions into robot motion without requiring the construction of large datasets or prior knowledge of the robot's kinematics model. InstructRobot employs a reinforcement learning algorithm that enables joint learning of language representations and inverse kinematics model, simplifying the entire learning process. The proposed framework is validated using a complex robot with 26 revolute joints in object manipulation tasks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in realistic environments. The framework can be applied to any task or domain where datasets are scarce and difficult to create, making it an intuitive and accessible solution to the challenges of training robots using linguistic communication. Open source code for the InstructRobot framework and experiments can be accessed at https://github.com/icleveston/InstructRobot.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches to incentivize LLMs' deep thinking abilities generally require large-scale data or significant training efforts. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how to improve the thinking abilities of less powerful base models. In this work, we introduce S$^2$R, an efficient framework that enhances LLM reasoning by teaching models to self-verify and self-correct during inference. Specifically, we first initialize LLMs with iterative self-verification and self-correction behaviors through supervised fine-tuning on carefully curated data. The self-verification and self-correction skills are then further strengthened by both outcome-level and process-level reinforcement learning, with minimized resource requirements, enabling the model to adaptively refine its reasoning process during inference. Our results demonstrate that, with only 3.1k self-verifying and self-correcting behavior initialization samples, Qwen2.5-math-7B achieves an accuracy improvement from 51.0\% to 81.6\%, outperforming models trained on an equivalent amount of long-CoT distilled data. Extensive experiments and analysis based on three base models across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks validate the effectiveness of S$^2$R. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/NineAbyss/S2R.</p></details> |  |

However, because of the rapid increase in network devices and services, it has become crucial to have targeted access to detailed network information in a dynamic network environment. This paper proposes an intelligent network telemetry system called NTP-INT to obtain more fine-grained network information on high-load switches. Specifically, NTP-INT consists of three modules: network traffic prediction module, network pruning module, and probe path planning module. Firstly, the network traffic prediction module adopts a Multi-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MTGNN) to predict future network traffic and identify high-load switches. Then, we design the network pruning algorithm to generate a subnetwork covering all high-load switches to reduce the complexity of probe path planning. Finally, the probe path planning module uses an attention-mechanism-based deep reinforcement learning (DEL) model to plan efficient probe paths in the network slice. The experimental results demonstrate that NTP-INT can acquire more precise network information on high-load switches while decreasing the control overhead by 50\%.</p></details> |  |

We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19--36\% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12594495.</p></details> |  |

Crucially, such LLMs need to ground their generations in any feedback obtained to reliably achieve the desired outcomes. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning method for teaching models to leverage execution feedback in the realm of code synthesis, where state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to improve code iteratively compared to independent sampling. We benchmark on competitive programming tasks, where we achieve new state-of-the art results with both small (8B parameters) and large (70B) models while reducing the amount of samples required by an order of magnitude. Our analysis of inference-time behavior demonstrates that our method produces LLMs that effectively leverage automatic feedback over multiple steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add r...</summary><p>Add repair model ablation, update related work</p></details> |

However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[On-Policy Self-Alignment with Fine-grained Knowledge Feedback for Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12221v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination occurs when large language models exhibit behavior that deviates from the boundaries of their knowledge during response generation. To address this critical issue, previous learning-based methods attempt to finetune models but are limited by off-policy sampling and coarse-grained feedback. In this paper, we present \textit{\b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning \b{f}or \b{H}allucination} (RLFH), an on-policy self-alignment approach that enables LLMs to actively explore their knowledge boundaries and self-correct generation behavior through fine-grained feedback signals. RLFH introduces a self-assessment framework where the policy serves as its own judge. Through this framework, responses are automatically decomposed into atomic facts and their truthfulness and informativeness are assessed against external knowledge sources. The resulting fine-grained feedback at the statement level are then converted into token-level dense reward signals. This enables online reinforcement learning to achieve precise and timely optimization without human intervention. Comprehensive evaluations on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and Biography benchmarks validate RLFH's effectiveness in hallucination mitigation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning to enhance tool-use capabilities, treating tool learning as a text-generation task while overlooking the decision-making complexities inherent in multi-step contexts. In this work, we propose modeling tool learning as a dynamic decision-making task and introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework that enhances the multi-step tool use capabilities of LLMs. StepTool consists of two main components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards at each tool interaction based on the success of tool invocation and its contribution to the task; and Step-grained Optimization, which uses policy gradient methods to optimize the model in a multi-step manner. Experimental results demonstrate that StepTool significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-step, tool-based tasks, offering a robust solution for tool learning.</p></details> | Ongoning Work |
| **[Multi-Step Alignment as Markov Games: An Optimistic Online Gradient Descent Approach with Convergence Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12678v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been highly successful in aligning large language models with human preferences. While prevalent methods like DPO have demonstrated strong performance, they frame interactions with the language model as a bandit problem, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where multi-turn conversations are common. Additionally, DPO relies on the Bradley-Terry model assumption, which does not adequately capture the non-transitive nature of human preferences. In this paper, we address these challenges by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player constant-sum Markov game, where each player seeks to maximize their winning rate against the other across all steps of the conversation. Our approach Multi-step Preference Optimization (MPO) is built upon the natural actor-critic framework~\citep{peters2008natural}. We further develop OMPO based on the optimistic online gradient descent algorithm~\citep{rakhlin2013online,joulani17a}. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis for both algorithms on convergence and show that OMPO requires $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ policy updates to converge to an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on multi-turn conversations dataset and math reasoning dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as oral presentation in NeurIPS LanGame Workshop, revised from ICLR submission</p></details> |
| **[Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11612v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with a Gaussian policy has become a mainstream implementation for realizing the Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) objective, which incorporates entropy maximization to encourage exploration and enhance policy robustness. While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/diffusionyes/MaxEntDP.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

Learning-based solutions to this challenge span between two extremes: i) shared-parameter methods, which encode diverse behaviors within a single architecture by assigning an ID to each agent, and are sample-efficient but result in limited behavioral diversity; ii) independent methods, which learn a separate policy for each agent, and show greater behavioral diversity but lack sample-efficiency. Prior work has also explored selective parameter-sharing, allowing for a compromise between diversity and efficiency. None of these approaches, however, effectively generalize to unseen agents or teams. We present Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a novel architecture for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination that generates sufficient diversity while maintaining sample-efficiency via soft parameter-sharing hypernetworks. Intuitively, CASH allows the team to learn common strategies using a shared encoder, which are then adapted according to the team's individual and collective capabilities with a hypernetwork, allowing for zero-shot generalization to unseen teams and agents. We present experiments across two heterogeneous coordination tasks and three standard learning paradigms (imitation learning, on- and off-policy reinforcement learning). CASH is able to outperform baseline architectures in success rate and sample efficiency when evaluated on unseen teams and agents despite using less than half of the learnable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, equal authorship between Pierce Howell and Shalin Jain</p></details> |

To improve their ability to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning, recent research leverages process reward modeling to provide fine-grained feedback at each step of the reasoning process for reinforcement learning (RL), but it predominantly focuses on English. In this paper, we tackle the critical challenge of extending process reward models (PRMs) to multilingual settings. To achieve this, we train multilingual PRMs on a dataset spanning seven languages, which is translated from English. Through comprehensive evaluations on two widely used reasoning benchmarks across 11 languages, we demonstrate that multilingual PRMs not only improve average accuracy but also reduce early-stage reasoning errors. Furthermore, our results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual PRMs to both the number of training languages and the volume of English data, while also uncovering the benefits arising from more candidate responses and trainable parameters. This work opens promising avenues for robust multilingual applications in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges in robustness when encountering distribution shifts. This paper explores improving diffusion-based imitation learning models through online interactions with the environment. We propose OTPR (Optimal Transport-guided score-based diffusion Policy for Reinforcement learning fine-tuning), a novel method that integrates diffusion policies with RL using optimal transport theory. OTPR leverages the Q-function as a transport cost and views the policy as an optimal transport map, enabling efficient and stable fine-tuning. Moreover, we introduce masked optimal transport to guide state-action matching using expert keypoints and a compatibility-based resampling strategy to enhance training stability. Experiments on three simulation tasks demonstrate OTPR's superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods, especially in complex and sparse-reward environments. In sum, OTPR provides an effective framework for combining IL and RL, achieving versatile and reliable policy learning. The code will be released at https://github.com/Sunmmyy/OTPR.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Repair with Reinforcement Learning in Emergent Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12624v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational repair is a mechanism used to detect and resolve miscommunication and misinformation problems when two or more agents interact. One particular and underexplored form of repair in emergent communication is the implicit repair mechanism, where the interlocutor purposely conveys the desired information in such a way as to prevent misinformation from any other interlocutor. This work explores how redundancy can modify the emergent communication protocol to continue conveying the necessary information to complete the underlying task, even with additional external environmental pressures such as noise. We focus on extending the signaling game, called the Lewis Game, by adding noise in the communication channel and inputs received by the agents. Our analysis shows that agents add redundancy to the transmitted messages as an outcome to prevent the negative impact of noise on the task success. Additionally, we observe that the emerging communication protocol's generalization capabilities remain equivalent to architectures employed in simpler games that are entirely deterministic. Additionally, our method is the only one suitable for producing robust communication protocols that can handle cases with and without noise while maintaining increased generalization performance levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAMAS...</summary><p>AAMAS 2025 - full paper</p></details> |

The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95 reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38 higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework combining graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the aircraft landing problem.

| **[Hypernetwork-based approach for optimal composition design in partially controlled multi-agent systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12605v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems (PCMAS) are comprised of controllable agents, managed by a system designer, and uncontrollable agents, operating autonomously. This study addresses an optimal composition design problem in PCMAS, which involves the system designer's problem, determining the optimal number and policies of controllable agents, and the uncontrollable agents' problem, identifying their best-response policies. Solving this bi-level optimization problem is computationally intensive, as it requires repeatedly solving multi-agent reinforcement learning problems under various compositions for both types of agents. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hypernetwork-based framework that jointly optimizes the system's composition and agent policies. Unlike traditional methods that train separate policy networks for each composition, the proposed framework generates policies for both controllable and uncontrollable agents through a unified hypernetwork. This approach enables efficient information sharing across similar configurations, thereby reducing computational overhead. Additional improvements are achieved by incorporating reward parameter optimization and mean action networks. Using real-world New York City taxi data, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in approximating equilibrium policies. Our experimental results show significant improvements in key performance metrics, such as order response rate and served demand, highlighting the practical utility of controlling agents and their potential to enhance decision-making in PCMAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a High-quality Robotic Wiping Policy Using Systematic Reward Analysis and Visual-Language Model Based Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12599v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic wiping is an important task in various industries, ranging from industrial manufacturing to sanitization in healthcare. Deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has emerged as a promising algorithm, however, it often suffers from a high demand for repetitive reward engineering. Instead of relying on manual tuning, we first analyze the convergence of quality-critical robotic wiping, which requires both high-quality wiping and fast task completion, to show the poor convergence of the problem and propose a new bounded reward formulation to make the problem feasible. Then, we further improve the learning process by proposing a novel visual-language model (VLM) based curriculum, which actively monitors the progress and suggests hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that the combined method can find a desirable wiping policy on surfaces with various curvatures, frictions, and waypoints, which cannot be learned with the baseline formulation.

| **[Enhancing the Capability and Robustness of Large Language Models through Reinforcement Learning-Driven Query Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01461v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate honest, harmless, and helpful responses heavily relies on the quality of user prompts. However, these prompts often tend to be brief and vague, thereby significantly limiting the full potential of LLMs. Moreover, harmful prompts can be meticulously crafted and manipulated by adversaries to jailbreak LLMs, inducing them to produce potentially toxic content. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs while maintaining strong robustness against harmful jailbreak inputs, this study proposes a transferable and pluggable framework that refines user prompts before they are input into LLMs. This strategy improves the quality of the queries, empowering LLMs to generate more truthful, benign and useful responses. Specifically, a lightweight query refinement model is introduced and trained using a specially designed reinforcement learning approach that incorporates multiple objectives to enhance particular capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the refinement model not only improves the quality of responses but also strengthens their robustness against jailbreak attacks.

We introduce a novel approach to treating the temporal field as a hyperparameter and examine its impact on model performance across various datasets and feature arrangements. We introduce a new hyperparameter for the CNN policy, proposing that this temporal field can and should be treated as a hyperparameter for these models. We examine the significance of this temporal field by iteratively expanding the window of observations presented to the CNN policy during the deep reinforcement learning process. Our iterative process involves progressively increasing the observation period from two weeks to twelve weeks, allowing us to examine the effects of different temporal windows on the model's performance. This window expansion is implemented in two settings. In one setting, we rearrange the features in the dataset to group them by company, allowing the model to have a full view of company data in its observation window and CNN kernel. In the second setting, we do not group the features by company, and features are arranged by category. Our study reveals that shorter temporal windows are most effective when no feature rearrangement to group per company is in effect. However, the model will utilize longer temporal windows and yield better performance once we introduce the feature rearrangement. To examine the consistency of our findings, we repeated our experiment on two datasets containing the same thirty companies from the Dow Jones Index but with different features in each dataset and consistently observed the above-mentioned patterns. The result is a trading model significantly outperforming global financial services firms such as the Global X Guru by the established Mirae Asset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triple Preference Optimization: Achieving Better Alignment using a Single Step Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16681v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, its limitations have led to the development of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an RL-free approach designed to overcome these shortcomings. While studies have shown that DPO improves instruction-following capabilities, it negatively impacts the reasoning ability of LLMs. Additionally, DPO is highly sensitive to judgment noise in preference datasets and the size of the training set. Although several modifications to DPO have been proposed, they still fail to fully resolve these issues. To address these limitations, we propose Triple Preference Optimization (TPO), a new preference learning method designed to enhance both reasoning and instruction-following abilities through one-step optimization. We compare TPO against DPO and its recent variants using state-of-the-art training setups, including both base and instruction-tuned models such as Mistral and Llama 3. Our evaluation covers a comprehensive range of chat-based and reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that TPO achieves significant improvements over existing methods without substantially increasing response length across different dataset sizes. Specifically, TPO outperforms DPO and SimPO by up to 7.0% and 7.3% points on Arena-Hard, 12.2% and 13.3% points on MixEval-Hard, 10.4% and 10.1% points on MMLU-Pro, and 19.0% and 19.2% points on GSM8K, respectively. Furthermore, TPO achieves these improvements while requiring less data than DPO.</p></details> |  |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite lots of approaches, like vision-based tactile sensors and reinforcement learning, having been proposed, the implementation of human-like high-reliable insertion (i.e., with a 100% success rate in completed insertion) remains a big challenge. Drawing inspiration from human behavior in FFC insertion, which involves sensing three-dimensional forces, translating them into physical concepts, and continuously improving estimates, we propose a novel framework. This framework includes a sensing module for collecting three-dimensional tactile data, a perception module for interpreting this data into meaningful physical signals, and a memory module based on Bayesian theory for reliability estimation and control. This strategy enables the robot to accurately assess its physical state and generate reliable status estimations and corrective actions. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot using this framework can detect alignment errors of 0.5 mm with an accuracy of 97.92% and then achieve a 100% success rate in all completed tests after a few iterations. This work addresses the challenges of unreliable perception and control in complex insertion tasks, highlighting the path toward the development of fully automated production lines.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks.

Supervised learning (SL)-based solvers require large amounts of high-quality labeled data, while reinforcement learning (RL)-based solvers, though less dependent on such data, often suffer from inefficiencies. To address these limitations, we propose LocalEscaper, a novel weakly-supervised learning framework for large-scale TSP. LocalEscaper effectively combines the advantages of both SL and RL, enabling effective training on datasets with low-quality labels. To further enhance solution quality, we introduce a regional reconstruction strategy, which mitigates the problem of local optima, a common issue in existing local reconstruction methods. Additionally, we propose a linear-complexity attention mechanism that reduces computational overhead, enabling the efficient solution of large-scale TSPs without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LocalEscaper outperforms existing neural solvers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, it sets a new benchmark for scalability and efficiency, solving TSP instances with up to 50,000 cities.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose \textsc{FLAG-Trader}, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Efficient RL under Episode-Wise Safety in Constrained MDPs with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10138v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), where an agent explores the environment to maximize the expected cumulative reward while satisfying a single constraint on the expected total utility value in every episode. While this problem is well understood in the tabular setting, theoretical results for function approximation remain scarce. This paper closes the gap by proposing an RL algorithm for linear CMDPs that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret with an episode-wise zero-violation guarantee. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient, scaling polynomially with problem-dependent parameters while remaining independent of the state space size. Our results significantly improve upon recent linear CMDP algorithms, which either violate the constraint or incur exponential computational costs.</p></details> |  |
