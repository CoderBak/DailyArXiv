| **[LLMs Are In-Context Bandit Reinforcement Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05362v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vintix: Action Model via In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19400v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code to be released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix</p></details> | Preprint.

A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19398v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities. Our results point to a weakness of contemporary LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in strategic interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19392v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Federated Sketching LoRA: On-Device Collaborative Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19389v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on devices is attracting increasing interest. Recent works have fused low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques with federated fine-tuning to mitigate challenges associated with device model sizes and data scarcity. Still, the heterogeneity of computational resources remains a critical bottleneck: while higher-rank modules generally enhance performance, varying device capabilities constrain LoRA's feasible rank range. Existing approaches attempting to resolve this issue either lack analytical justification or impose additional computational overhead, leaving a wide gap for an efficient and theoretically-grounded solution. To address these challenges, we propose federated sketching LoRA (FSLoRA), which leverages a sketching mechanism to enable devices to selectively update submatrices of global LoRA modules maintained by the server. By adjusting the sketching ratios, which determine the ranks of the submatrices on the devices, FSLoRA flexibly adapts to device-specific communication and computational constraints. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of FSLoRA that characterizes how the sketching ratios affect the convergence rate. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and LLM models, we demonstrate FSLoRA's superior performance compared to various baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[SELMA: A Speech-Enabled Language Model for Virtual Assistant Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19377v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[GPT-4o as the Gold Standard: A Scalable and General Purpose Approach to Filter Language Model Pretraining Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02755v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models require vast amounts of high-quality training data, but effective filtering of web-scale datasets remains a significant challenge. This paper demonstrates that GPT-4o is remarkably effective at identifying high-quality training data, but its prohibitive cost makes it impractical at web-scale. We propose SIEVE, a lightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at less than 1\% of the cost. SIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o filtering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and lightweight text classification models, using active learning to fine-tune these models in the background with a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as GPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost. Through different filtering prompts, SIEVE can efficiently curate high quality data for general or specialized domains from web-scale corpora -- a valuable capability given the current scarcity of high-quality domain-specific datasets. Extensive experiments using automatic and human evaluation metrics show that SIEVE and GPT-4o achieve similar performance on five highly specific filtering prompts. In addition, when performing quality filtering on web crawl datasets, we demonstrate SIEVE can further improve over state-of-the-art quality filtering methods in the DataComp-LM challenge for selecting LLM pretraining data.</p></details> |  |
| **[We're Different, We're the Same: Creative Homogeneity Across LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19361v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous powerful large language models (LLMs) are now available for use as writing support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these LLMs are marketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an LLM as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs. However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single LLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We find that LLM responses are much more similar to other LLM responses than human responses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and other key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative outputs across the LLMs we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about creativity and LLMs. If today's LLMs behave similarly, using them as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all users towards a limited set of "creative" outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of \texttt{EPPO} in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Towards Adaptive Self-Improvement for Smarter Energy Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19340v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for decision-making and optimization, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for adaptive code generation. Instead of direct decision-making, LLMs generate and refine executable control policies through a meta-policy that guides task generation and a base policy for operational actions. Applied to a simplified microgrid scenario, the approach achieves up to 15 percent cost savings by iteratively improving battery control strategies. The proposed methodology lays a foundation for integrating LLM-based tools into planning and control tasks, offering adaptable and scalable solutions for complex systems while addressing challenges of uncertainty and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexiGPT: Pruning and Extending Large Language Models with Low-Rank Weight Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14713v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has created a critical need for techniques that enable efficient deployment on memory-constrained devices without compromising performance. We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 - Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Homogeneity Bias as Differential Sampling Uncertainty in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19337v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior research show that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) represent marginalized groups more homogeneously than dominant groups. However, the mechanisms underlying this homogeneity bias remain relatively unexplored. We propose that this bias emerges from systematic differences in the probability distributions from which tokens are sampled at inference-time. Analyzing three measures of uncertainty in token sampling distributions-entropy, perplexity, and probability of differentiation-we find that in some models, specifically GPT-4 Turbo and Llama-3.2, tokens are sampled more deterministically when generating texts about marginalized groups (i.e., Black Americans and women) compared to their dominant group counterparts (i.e., White Americans and men). While these findings may help explain homogeneity bias in certain models, the patterns did not replicate across all VLMs tested, suggesting multiple mechanisms may contribute to homogeneity bias in AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted as a full paper for AAMAS 2025.

| **[Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19324v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[MINDSTORES: Memory-Informed Neural Decision Synthesis for Task-Oriented Reinforcement in Embodied Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19318v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Affective Text Generation Quality Based on Different Quantization Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19317v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models exhibit a remarkable capacity in language generation and comprehension. These advances enable AI systems to produce more human-like and emotionally engaging text. However, these models rely on a large number of parameters, requiring significant computational resources for training and inference. In some scenarios, accessing these resources can be challenging (e.g., budget or hardware limitations). Techniques like reducing precision bits can make models more memory-efficient, reducing the computational resources needed, at the cost of reduced accuracy. This paper addresses the trade-off between different quantization values, GPU RAM utilization, and text quality in affective text generation (e.g., "I really enjoy running in the snow-covered forest"). To evaluate, we use an emotion classifier and ten seed prompts to generate affective text. We test three setups of precision bits (8, 16, and 32) across five open-weight language models from two different families. Our findings demonstrate that bit reductions lead to memory savings, achieving a reduction of 76%. However, this optimization comes with a trade-off, leading to a decrease of up to 10 pp in F1 score for larger models and an increase of 10 pp for smaller models, along with roughly double the inference time. In terms of text quality, larger models at lower quantization levels generally outperform smaller, higher-precision models -- while requiring similar memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Judge Decoding: Faster Speculative Sampling Requires Going Beyond Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19309v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely linked to their underlying size, leading to ever-growing networks and hence slower inference. Speculative decoding has been proposed as a technique to accelerate autoregressive generation, leveraging a fast draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified in parallel based on their likelihood under the target model. While this approach guarantees to reproduce the target output, it incurs a substantial penalty: many high-quality draft tokens are rejected, even when they represent objectively valid continuations. Indeed, we show that even powerful draft models such as GPT-4o, as well as human text cannot achieve high acceptance rates under the standard verification scheme. This severely limits the speedup potential of current speculative decoding methods, as an early rejection becomes overwhelmingly likely when solely relying on alignment of draft and target. We thus ask the following question: Can we adapt verification to recognize correct, but non-aligned replies? To this end, we draw inspiration from the LLM-as-a-judge framework, which demonstrated that LLMs are able to rate answers in a versatile way. We carefully design a dataset to elicit the same capability in the target model by training a compact module on top of the embeddings to produce ``judgements" of the current continuation. We showcase our strategy on the Llama-3.1 family, where our 8b/405B-Judge achieves a speedup of 9x over Llama-405B, while maintaining its quality on a large range of benchmarks. These benefits remain present even in optimized inference frameworks, where our method reaches up to 141 tokens/s for 8B/70B-Judge and 129 tokens/s for 8B/405B on 2 and 8 H100s respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[SETS: Leveraging Self-Verification and Self-Correction for Improved Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19306v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

This rapid advancement has spurred research into various aspects of LLMs, their text generation & reasoning capability, and potential misuse, fueling the necessity for robust detection methods. While numerous prior research has focused on detecting LLM-generated text (AI text) and thus checkmating them, our study investigates a relatively unexplored territory: portraying the nuanced distinctions between human and AI texts across text segments. Whether LLMs struggle with or excel at incorporating linguistic ingenuity across different text segments carries substantial implications for determining their potential as effective creative assistants to humans. Through an analogy with the structure of chess games-comprising opening, middle, and end games-we analyze text segments (introduction, body, and conclusion) to determine where the most significant distinctions between human and AI texts exist. While AI texts can approximate the body segment better due to its increased length, a closer examination reveals a pronounced disparity, highlighting the importance of this segment in AI text detection. Additionally, human texts exhibit higher cross-segment differences compared to AI texts. Overall, our research can shed light on the intricacies of human-AI text distinctions, offering novel insights for text detection and understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, single columns, under review at Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline Learning for Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19300v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a fundamental sequential decision-making framework, extensively studied over the past decade. However, existing work primarily focuses on the online setting, overlooking the substantial costs of online interactions and the readily available offline datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Off-CMAB, the first offline learning framework for CMAB. Central to our framework is the combinatorial lower confidence bound (CLCB) algorithm, which combines pessimistic reward estimations with combinatorial solvers. To characterize the quality of offline datasets, we propose two novel data coverage conditions and prove that, under these conditions, CLCB achieves a near-optimal suboptimality gap, matching the theoretical lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. We validate Off-CMAB through practical applications, including learning to rank, large language model (LLM) caching, and social influence maximization, showing its ability to handle nonlinear reward functions, general feedback models, and out-of-distribution action samples that excludes optimal or even feasible actions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets further highlight the superior performance of CLCB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic User Behavior Sequence Generation with Large Language Models for Smart Homes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19298v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, as smart home systems have become more widespread, security concerns within these environments have become a growing threat. Currently, most smart home security solutions, such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction models, are trained using fixed datasets that are precollected. However, the process of dataset collection is time-consuming and lacks the flexibility needed to adapt to the constantly evolving smart home environment. Additionally, the collection of personal data raises significant privacy concerns for users. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks across diverse application domains, thanks to their strong capabilities in natural language processing, reasoning, and problem-solving. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based synthetic dataset generation IoTGen framework to enhance the generalization of downstream smart home intelligent models. By generating new synthetic datasets that reflect changes in the environment, smart home intelligent models can be retrained to overcome the limitations of fixed and outdated data, allowing them to better align with the dynamic nature of real-world home environments. Specifically, we first propose a Structure Pattern Perception Compression (SPPC) method tailored for IoT behavior data, which preserves the most informative content in the data while significantly reducing token consumption. Then, we propose a systematic approach to create prompts and implement data generation to automatically generate IoT synthetic data with normative and reasonable properties, assisting task models in adaptive training to improve generalization and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of LLMs vs Human Experts in Requirements Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19297v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures |
| **[UniGuard: Towards Universal Safety Guardrails for Jailbreak Attacks on Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01703v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized vision-language understanding but remain vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks, where adversarial inputs are meticulously crafted to elicit harmful or inappropriate responses. We propose UniGuard, a novel multimodal safety guardrail that jointly considers the unimodal and cross-modal harmful signals. UniGuard trains a multimodal guardrail to minimize the likelihood of generating harmful responses in a toxic corpus. The guardrail can be seamlessly applied to any input prompt during inference with minimal computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability of UniGuard across multiple modalities, attack strategies, and multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs, including LLaVA, Gemini Pro, GPT-4o, MiniGPT-4, and InstructBLIP. Notably, this robust defense mechanism maintains the models' overall vision-language understanding capabilities.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Low-Cost and Comprehensive Non-textual Input Fuzzing with LLM-Synthesized Input Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19282v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software often accepts inputs with highly complex grammars. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that they can be used to synthesize high-quality natural language text and code that conforms to the grammar of a given input format. Nevertheless, LLMs are often incapable or too costly to generate non-textual outputs, such as images, videos, and PDF files. This limitation hinders the application of LLMs in grammar-aware fuzzing. We present a novel approach to enabling grammar-aware fuzzing over non-textual inputs. We employ LLMs to synthesize and also mutate input generators, in the form of Python scripts, that generate data conforming to the grammar of a given input format. Then, non-textual data yielded by the input generators are further mutated by traditional fuzzers (AFL++) to explore the software input space effectively. Our approach, namely G2FUZZ, features a hybrid strategy that combines a holistic search driven by LLMs and a local search driven by industrial quality fuzzers. Two key advantages are: (1) LLMs are good at synthesizing and mutating input generators and enabling jumping out of local optima, thus achieving a synergistic effect when combined with mutation-based fuzzers; (2) LLMs are less frequently invoked unless really needed, thus significantly reducing the cost of LLM usage. We have evaluated G2FUZZ on a variety of input formats, including TIFF images, MP4 audios, and PDF files. The results show that G2FUZZ outperforms SOTA tools such as AFL++, Fuzztruction, and FormatFuzzer in terms of code coverage and bug finding across most programs tested on three platforms: UNIFUZZ, FuzzBench, and MAGMA.</p></details> | USENIX Security 2025 |

We introduce Ant Colony Optimization-guided Tree of Thought (ACO-ToT), a novel algorithm that combines ACO with LLMs to discover optimal reasoning paths for complex problems efficiently. Drawing inspiration from Hebbian learning in neurological systems, our method employs a collection of distinctly fine-tuned LLM "ants" to traverse and lay pheromone trails through a centralized tree of thought, with each ant's movement governed by a weighted combination of existing pheromone trails and its own specialized expertise. The algorithm evaluates complete reasoning paths using a mixture-of-experts-based scoring function, with pheromones reinforcing productive reasoning paths across iterations. Experiments on three challenging reasoning tasks (GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, and MATH) demonstrate that ACO-ToT performs significantly better than existing chain-of-thought optimization approaches, suggesting that incorporating biologically inspired collective search mechanisms into LLM inference can substantially enhance reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To help navigate the responsible integration of AI into QDA, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 HCI researchers experienced in QDA. While our participants were open to AI support in their QDA workflows, they expressed concerns about data privacy, autonomy, and the quality of AI outputs. In response, we developed a framework that spans from minimal to high AI involvement, providing tangible scenarios for integrating AI into HCI researchers' QDA practices while addressing their needs and concerns. Aligned with real-life QDA workflows, we identify potentials for AI tools in areas such as data pre-processing, researcher onboarding, or mediation. Our framework aims to provoke further discussion on the development of AI-supported QDA and to help establish community standards for their responsible use.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuiGPT MAD: Move AI Decompiler to Improve Transparency and Auditability on Non-Open-Source Blockchain Smart Contract](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15275v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision of Web3 is to improve user control over data and assets, but one challenge that complicates this vision is the prevalence of non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts that put Web3 users at risk. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ACM The Web Conference 2025</p></details> |

Alignment as a Maximal Lottery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19266v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the standard for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, is known to fail to satisfy properties that are intuitively desirable, such as respecting the preferences of the majority \cite{ge2024axioms}. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of a probabilistic Social Choice rule called \emph{maximal lotteries} as a replacement for RLHF. We show that a family of alignment techniques, namely Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) \cite{munos2023nash} and variants, approximate maximal lottery outcomes and thus inherit its beneficial properties. We confirm experimentally that our proposed methodology handles situations that arise when working with preferences more robustly than standard RLHF, including supporting the preferences of the majority, providing principled ways of handling non-transitivities in the preference data, and robustness to irrelevant alternatives. This results in systems that better incorporate human values and respect human intentions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Separate Instructions From Data? And What Do We Even Mean By That?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06833v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive results in numerous practical applications, but they lack essential safety features that are common in other areas of computer science, particularly an explicit separation of instructions and data. This makes them vulnerable to manipulations such as indirect prompt injections and generally unsuitable for safety-critical tasks. Surprisingly, there is currently no established definition or benchmark to quantify this phenomenon. In this work, we close this gap by introducing a formal measure for instruction-data separation and an empirical variant that is calculable from a model's outputs. We also present a new dataset, SEP, that allows estimating the measure for real-world models. Our results on various LLMs show that the problem of instruction-data separation is real: all models fail to achieve high separation, and canonical mitigation techniques, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, either fail to substantially improve separation or reduce model utility. The source code and SEP dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025, GitHub: https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed. 10 pages main text, 30 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17974v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. In this work, we propose a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming our algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to ``understand'' the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, our best models are able to have a $4.14$\% and $5.74$\% absolute improvement ($8.08$\% and $11.2$\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using $2.16$x and $4.32$x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately $2$x those of self-consistency under the same budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Zero-Shot Generalization Framework for LLM-Driven Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19232v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions in unseen domains without the need for additional training or fine-tuning, making it particularly valuable in data-sparse environments where traditional models struggle. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved ZCDSR by leveraging rich pretrained representations to facilitate cross-domain knowledge transfer. However, a key challenge persists: domain semantic bias, which arises from variations in vocabulary and content focus across domains. This misalignment leads to inconsistencies in item embeddings and hinders generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework designed to enhance LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that promotes inter-domain compactness by aligning embeddings of similar items across domains while maintaining intra-domain diversity to preserve unique item characteristics. This prevents embeddings from becoming overly generic while ensuring effective transferability. At the sequential level, we develop a method for transferring user behavioral patterns by clustering user sequences in the source domain and applying attention-based aggregation for target domain inference. This dynamic adaptation of user embeddings allows effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and domains demonstrate that our framework significantly improves sequential recommendation performance in the ZCDSR setting. By mitigating domain bias and enhancing the transferability of sequential patterns, our method provides a scalable and robust approach for achieving more effective zero-shot recommendations across domains.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Universal Feature Spaces Across Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06981v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate feature universality in large language models (LLMs), a research field that aims to understand how different models similarly represent concepts in the latent spaces of their intermediate layers. Demonstrating feature universality allows discoveries about latent representations to generalize across several models. However, comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which individual neurons often correspond to multiple features rather than distinct ones, making it difficult to disentangle and match features across different models. To address this issue, we employ a method known as dictionary learning by using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces spanned by neurons corresponding to individual features. After matching feature neurons across models via activation correlation, we apply representational space similarity metrics on SAE feature spaces across different LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing new evidence for feature universality.</p></details> |  |

As LLM capabilities expand, they offer new possibilities such as code refactoring, security enhancements, and legacy application upgrades. Many outdated web applications pose security and reliability challenges, yet companies continue using them due to the complexity and cost of upgrades. To address this, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system that autonomously upgrades legacy web applications to the latest versions. The system distributes tasks across multiple phases, updating all relevant files. To evaluate its effectiveness, we employed Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts, applying identical instructions in both cases. The evaluation involved updating view files and measuring the number and types of errors in the output. For complex tasks, we counted the successfully met requirements. The experiments compared the proposed system with standalone LLM execution, repeated multiple times to account for stochastic behavior. Results indicate that our system maintains context across tasks and agents, improving solution quality over the base model in some cases. This study provides a foundation for future model implementations in legacy code updates. Additionally, findings highlight LLMs' ability to update small outdated files with high precision, even with basic prompts. The source code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/alasalm1/Multi-agent-pipeline.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper, we show that RM methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in RM models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation -- a model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of RM methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of RM models while enhancing the unlearning performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, the verbose nature of textual reasoning introduces significant inefficiencies. In this work, we propose $\textbf{Heima}$ (as hidden llama), an efficient reasoning framework that leverages reasoning CoTs at hidden latent space. We design the Heima Encoder to condense each intermediate CoT into a compact, higher-level hidden representation using a single thinking token, effectively minimizing verbosity and reducing the overall number of tokens required during the reasoning process. Meanwhile, we design corresponding Heima Decoder with traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) to adaptively interpret the hidden representations into variable-length textual sequence, reconstructing reasoning processes that closely resemble the original CoTs. Experimental results across diverse reasoning MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that Heima model achieves higher generation efficiency while maintaining or even better zero-shot task accuracy. Moreover, the effective reconstruction of multimodal reasoning processes with Heima Decoder validates both the robustness and interpretability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint version |

However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency often hinder their direct application for predictive tasks where privacy and interpretability are paramount. In fields such as healthcare, biology, and finance, specialised and interpretable linear models still hold considerable value. In such domains, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Well-specified prior distributions over model parameters can reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference; however, eliciting expert priors can be time-consuming. We therefore introduce AutoElicit to extract knowledge from LLMs and construct priors for predictive models. We show these priors are informative and can be refined using natural language. We perform a careful study contrasting AutoElicit with in-context learning and demonstrate how to perform model selection between the two methods. We find that AutoElicit yields priors that can substantially reduce error over uninformative priors, using fewer labels, and consistently outperform in-context learning. We show that AutoElicit saves over 6 months of labelling effort when building a new predictive model for urinary tract infections from sensor recordings of people living with dementia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Model Evaluation as Narrowing the Socio-Technical Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03100v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of generative large language models (LLMs) poses new challenges for model evaluation that the research community and industry have been grappling with. While the versatile capabilities of these models ignite much excitement, they also inevitably make a leap toward homogenization: powering a wide range of applications with a single, often referred to as ``general-purpose'', model. In this position paper, we argue that model evaluation practices must take on a critical task to cope with the challenges and responsibilities brought by this homogenization: providing valid assessments for whether and how much human needs in diverse downstream use cases can be satisfied by the given model (\textit{socio-technical gap}). By drawing on lessons about improving research realism from the social sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and the interdisciplinary field of explainable AI (XAI), we urge the community to develop evaluation methods based on real-world contexts and human requirements, and embrace diverse evaluation methods with an acknowledgment of trade-offs between realisms and pragmatic costs to conduct the evaluation. By mapping HCI and current NLG evaluation methods, we identify opportunities for evaluation methods for LLMs to narrow the socio-technical gap and pose open questions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Model Defense Against Jailbreaks with Proactive Safety Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19180v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vital for a wide range of applications yet remain susceptible to jailbreak threats, which could lead to the generation of inappropriate responses. Conventional defenses, such as refusal and adversarial training, often fail to cover corner cases or rare domains, leaving LLMs still vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks. We propose a novel defense strategy, Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which harnesses the enhanced \textit{reasoning capabilities} of LLMs for proactive assessment of harmful inputs, rather than simply blocking them. SCoT augments any refusal training datasets to critically analyze the intent behind each request before generating answers. By employing proactive reasoning, SCoT enhances the generalization of LLMs across varied harmful queries and scenarios not covered in the safety alignment corpus. Additionally, it generates detailed refusals specifying the rules violated. Comparative evaluations show that SCoT significantly surpasses existing defenses, reducing vulnerability to out-of-distribution issues and adversarial manipulations while maintaining strong general capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This is an encouraging development. The CI theory emphasizes sharing information in accordance with privacy norms and can bridge the social, legal, political, and technical aspects essential for evaluating privacy in LLMs. However, this is also a good point to reflect on use of CI for LLMs. This position paper argues that existing literature adopts CI for LLMs without embracing the theory's fundamental tenets, essentially amounting to a form of "CI-washing." CI-washing could lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed privacy-preserving designs. We clarify the four fundamental tenets of CI theory, systematize prior work on whether they deviate from these tenets, and highlight overlooked issues in experimental hygiene for LLMs (e.g., prompt sensitivity, positional bias).</p></details> | 11 pages |

A major challenge compromising their reliability is object hallucination that LVMs may generate plausible but factually inaccurate information. We propose a novel visual adversarial perturbation (VAP) method to mitigate this hallucination issue. VAP alleviates LVM hallucination by applying strategically optimized visual noise without altering the base model. Our approach formulates hallucination suppression as an optimization problem, leveraging adversarial strategies to generate beneficial visual perturbations that enhance the model's factual grounding and reduce parametric knowledge bias. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently reduces object hallucinations across 8 state-of-the-art LVMs, validating its efficacy across diverse evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Vaccine: Safety Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Layer-wise Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09760v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harmful fine-tuning attack poses a serious threat to the online fine-tuning service. Vaccine, a recent alignment-stage defense, applies uniform perturbation to all layers of embedding to make the model robust to the simulated embedding drift. However, applying layer-wise uniform perturbation may lead to excess perturbations for some particular safety-irrelevant layers, resulting in defense performance degradation and unnecessary memory consumption. To address this limitation, we propose Targeted Vaccine (T-Vaccine), a memory-efficient safety alignment method that applies perturbation to only selected layers of the model. T-Vaccine follows two core steps: First, it uses gradient norm as a statistical metric to identify the safety-critical layers. Second, instead of applying uniform perturbation across all layers, T-Vaccine only applies perturbation to the safety-critical layers while keeping other layers frozen during training. Results show that T-Vaccine outperforms Vaccine in terms of both defense effectiveness and resource efficiency. Comparison with other defense baselines, e.g., RepNoise and TAR also demonstrate the superiority of T-Vaccine. Notably, T-Vaccine is the first defense that can address harmful fine-tuning issues for a 7B pre-trained models trained on consumer GPUs with limited memory (e.g., RTX 4090). Our code is available at https://github.com/Lslland/T-Vaccine.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding. However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset. To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited. The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM. Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As linear layers in LLMs are mainly resource consuming parts, this paper develops a tensor-train decomposition (TTD) for LLMs with a further hardware implementation on FPGA. TTD compression is applied to the linear layers in ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models with compression ratios (CRs) for the whole network 1.94$\times$ and 1.60$\times$, respectively. The compressed LLMs are further implemented on FPGA hardware within a highly efficient group vector systolic array (GVSA) architecture, which has DSP-shared parallel vector PEs for TTD inference, as well as optimized data communication in the accelerator. Experimental results show that the corresponding TTD based LLM accelerator implemented on FPGA achieves 1.45$\times$ and 1.57$\times$ reduction in first token delay for ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) have native preference-learning capabilities that allow them to achieve sample-efficient preference learning, addressing this challenge. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), which uses in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to reduce human query inefficiency. ICPL uses the task description and basic environment code to create sets of reward functions which are iteratively refined by placing human feedback over videos of the resultant policies into the context of an LLM and then requesting better rewards. We first demonstrate ICPL's effectiveness through a synthetic preference study, providing quantitative evidence that it significantly outperforms baseline preference-based methods with much higher performance and orders of magnitude greater efficiency. We observe that these improvements are not solely coming from LLM grounding in the task but that the quality of the rewards improves over time, indicating preference learning capabilities. Additionally, we perform a series of real human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.</p></details> |  |

However, ZO methods suffer from slow convergence due to high-variance stochastic gradient estimators. While structured perturbations, such as sparsity and low-rank constraints, have been explored to mitigate these issues, their effectiveness remains highly under-explored. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that analyzes both the convergence and generalization properties of ZO optimization under structured perturbations. We show that high dimensionality is the primary bottleneck and introduce the notions of \textit{stable rank} and \textit{effective overlap} to explain how structured perturbations reduce gradient noise and accelerate convergence. Using the uniform stability under our framework, we then provide the first theoretical justification for why these perturbations enhance generalization. Additionally, through empirical analysis, we identify that \textbf{block coordinate descent} (BCD) to be an effective structured perturbation method. Extensive experiments show that, compared to existing alternatives, memory-efficient ZO (MeZO) with BCD (\textit{MeZO-BCD}) can provide improved converge with a faster wall-clock time/iteration by up to $\times\textbf{2.09}$ while yielding similar or better accuracy.</p></details> | 35 pages, 5 figures |

Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its tensor coherence and GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning has struggled to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity (PPL) at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving an additional 24.2\% memory savings and 24.6\% faster inference over low-rank layers at r/d = 0.5, thereby significantly enhancing performance at the same density. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free low-rank reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.</p></details> |  |

This is because of their inability to recognize their limited understanding of the user's physical context. We present SituationalLLM, a novel approach that integrates structured scene information into an LLM to deliver proactive, context-aware assistance. By encoding objects, attributes, and relationships in a custom Scene Graph Language, SituationalLLM actively identifies gaps in environmental context and seeks clarifications during user interactions. This behavior emerges from training on the Situational Awareness Database for Instruct-Tuning (SAD-Instruct), which combines diverse, scenario-specific scene graphs with iterative, dialogue-based refinements. Experimental results indicate that SituationalLLM outperforms generic LLM baselines in task specificity, reliability, and adaptability, paving the way for environment-aware AI assistants capable of delivering robust, user-centric guidance under real-world constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised Submission to Open Research Europe</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Code Generation for Low-Resource Languages: No Silver Bullet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19085v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to learn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For low-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the scarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the models' ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation performance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is a quest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an empirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for boosting LLMs' performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) a classic fine-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data; (ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the LLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot examples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) a pre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between high- and low-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages (R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our findings reveal that a fine-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs, possibly due to the fact that even a small dataset is sufficient to train their limited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models, in-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing a safe and cheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently, very large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages when fine-tuning is performed, possibly due to the lack of enough data needed to effectively update their weights.</p></details> | Accepted at ICPC'25 |

| **[LLMs Are In-Context Bandit Reinforcement Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05362v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18101v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training of language models, either through reinforcement learning, preference optimization or supervised finetuning, tends to sharpen the output probability distribution and reduce the diversity of generated responses. This is particularly a problem for creative generative tasks where varied responses are desired. In this work we introduce Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO), an optimization method which learns to generate much more diverse responses than standard pipelines, while maintaining the quality of the generations. In DivPO, preference pairs are selected by first considering a pool of responses, and a measure of diversity among them, and selecting chosen examples as being more rare but high quality, while rejected examples are more common, but low quality. DivPO results in generating 45.6% more diverse persona attributes, and an 74.6% increase in story diversity, while maintaining similar win rates as standard baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vintix: Action Model via In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19400v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code to be released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of \texttt{EPPO} in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Drama: Mamba-Enabled Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Is Sample and Parameter Efficient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08893v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often demands complex and deep architectures, which are expensive to compute and train. Within the world model, dynamics models are particularly crucial for accurate predictions, and various dynamics-model architectures have been explored, each with its own set of challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN) based world models face issues such as vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies effectively. In contrast, use of transformers suffers from the well-known issues of self-attention mechanisms, where both memory and computational complexity scale as $O(n^2)$, with $n$ representing the sequence length. To address these challenges we propose a state space model (SSM) based world model, specifically based on Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and facilitating the use of longer training sequences efficiently. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early stages of training, combining it with the aforementioned technique to achieve a normalised score comparable to other state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms using only a 7 million trainable parameter world model. This model is accessible and can be trained on an off-the-shelf laptop. Our code is available at https://github.com/realwenlongwang/Drama.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Jackpot! Alignment as a Maximal Lottery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19266v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the standard for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, is known to fail to satisfy properties that are intuitively desirable, such as respecting the preferences of the majority \cite{ge2024axioms}. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of a probabilistic Social Choice rule called \emph{maximal lotteries} as a replacement for RLHF. We show that a family of alignment techniques, namely Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) \cite{munos2023nash} and variants, approximate maximal lottery outcomes and thus inherit its beneficial properties. We confirm experimentally that our proposed methodology handles situations that arise when working with preferences more robustly than standard RLHF, including supporting the preferences of the majority, providing principled ways of handling non-transitivities in the preference data, and robustness to irrelevant alternatives. This results in systems that better incorporate human values and respect human intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Objective Metrics for Human-Subjects Evaluation in Explainable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19256v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanation is a fundamentally human process. Understanding the goal and audience of the explanation is vital, yet existing work on explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) routinely does not consult humans in their evaluations. Even when they do, they routinely resort to subjective metrics, such as confidence or understanding, that can only inform researchers of users' opinions, not their practical effectiveness for a given problem. This paper calls on researchers to use objective human metrics for explanation evaluations based on observable and actionable behaviour to build more reproducible, comparable, and epistemically grounded research. To this end, we curate, describe, and compare several objective evaluation methodologies for applying explanations to debugging agent behaviour and supporting human-agent teaming, illustrating our proposed methods using a novel grid-based environment. We discuss how subjective and objective metrics complement each other to provide holistic validation and how future work needs to utilise standardised benchmarks for testing to enable greater comparisons between research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear $Q$-Learning Does Not Diverge: Convergence Rates to a Bounded Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19254v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>$Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. Previously, it is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning to a bounded set. Notably, we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOP-ERL: Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09536v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning (TOP-ERL), a novel algorithm that enables off-policy updates in the ERL framework. In ERL, policies predict entire action trajectories over multiple time steps instead of single actions at every time step. These trajectories are typically parameterized by trajectory generators such as Movement Primitives (MP), allowing for smooth and efficient exploration over long horizons while capturing high-level temporal correlations. However, ERL methods are often constrained to on-policy frameworks due to the difficulty of evaluating state-action values for entire action sequences, limiting their sample efficiency and preventing the use of more efficient off-policy architectures. TOP-ERL addresses this shortcoming by segmenting long action sequences and estimating the state-action values for each segment using a transformer-based critic architecture alongside an n-step return estimation. These contributions result in efficient and stable training that is reflected in the empirical results conducted on sophisticated robot learning environments. TOP-ERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods. Thorough ablation studies additionally show the impact of key design choices on the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/BruceGeLi/TOP_ERL_ICLR25. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.11437</p></details> |
| **[SHARPIE: A Modular Framework for Reinforcement Learning and Human-AI Interaction Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19245v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a general approach for modeling and training AI agents, including human-AI interaction scenarios. In this paper, we propose SHARPIE (Shared Human-AI Reinforcement Learning Platform for Interactive Experiments) to address the need for a generic framework to support experiments with RL agents and humans. Its modular design consists of a versatile wrapper for RL environments and algorithm libraries, a participant-facing web interface, logging utilities, deployment on popular cloud and participant recruitment platforms. It empowers researchers to study a wide variety of research questions related to the interaction between humans and RL agents, including those related to interactive reward specification and learning, learning from human feedback, action delegation, preference elicitation, user-modeling, and human-AI teaming. The platform is based on a generic interface for human-RL interactions that aims to standardize the field of study on RL in human contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Gradient Methods for Risk-Sensitive Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Provable Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14749v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for maintaining reliable performance in high-stakes applications. While traditional RL methods aim to learn a point estimate of the random cumulative cost, distributional RL (DRL) seeks to estimate the entire distribution of it, which leads to a unified framework for handling different risk measures. However, developing policy gradient methods for risk-sensitive DRL is inherently more complex as it involves finding the gradient of a probability measure. This paper introduces a new policy gradient method for risk-sensitive DRL with general coherent risk measures, where we provide an analytical form of the probability measure's gradient for any distribution. For practical use, we design a categorical distributional policy gradient algorithm (CDPG) that approximates any distribution by a categorical family supported on some fixed points. We further provide a finite-support optimality guarantee and a finite-iteration convergence guarantee under inexact policy evaluation and gradient estimation. Through experiments on stochastic Cliffwalk and CartPole environments, we illustrate the benefits of considering a risk-sensitive setting in DRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis of Autonomous Cyber-Defence Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19206v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rise in increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks raises the need for robust and resilient autonomous cyber-defence (ACD) agents. Given the variety of cyber-attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed, learning approaches that can return generalisable policies are desirable. Meanwhile, the assurance of ACD agents remains an open challenge. We address both challenges via an empirical game-theoretic analysis of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches for ACD using the principled double oracle (DO) algorithm. This algorithm relies on adversaries iteratively learning (approximate) best responses against each others' policies; a computationally expensive endeavour for autonomous cyber operations agents. In this work we introduce and evaluate a theoretically-sound, potential-based reward shaping approach to expedite this process. In addition, given the increasing number of open-source ACD-DRL approaches, we extend the DO formulation to allow for multiple response oracles (MRO), providing a framework for a holistic evaluation of ACD approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Stable Offline Value Function Learning with Bisimulation-based Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01643v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, offline value function learning is the procedure of using an offline dataset to estimate the expected discounted return from each state when taking actions according to a fixed target policy. The stability of this procedure, i.e., whether it converges to its fixed-point, critically depends on the representations of the state-action pairs. Poorly learned representations can make value function learning unstable, or even divergent. Therefore, it is critical to stabilize value function learning by explicitly shaping the state-action representations. Recently, the class of bisimulation-based algorithms have shown promise in shaping representations for control. However, it is still unclear if this class of methods can stabilize value function learning. In this work, we investigate this question and answer it affirmatively. We introduce a bisimulation-based algorithm called kernel representations for offline policy evaluation (KROPE). KROPE uses a kernel to shape state-action representations such that state-action pairs that have similar immediate rewards and lead to similar next state-action pairs under the target policy also have similar representations. We show that KROPE: 1) learns stable representations and 2) leads to lower value error than baselines. Our analysis provides new theoretical insight into the stability properties of bisimulation-based methods and suggests that practitioners can use these methods for stable and accurate evaluation of offline reinforcement learning agents.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Adaptive Learn-then-Test: Statistically Valid and Efficient Hyperparameter Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15844v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce adaptive learn-then-test (aLTT), an efficient hyperparameter selection procedure that provides finite-sample statistical guarantees on the population risk of AI models. Unlike the existing learn-then-test (LTT) technique, which relies on conventional p-value-based multiple hypothesis testing (MHT), aLTT implements sequential data-dependent MHT with early termination by leveraging e-processes. As a result, aLTT can reduce the number of testing rounds, making it particularly well-suited for scenarios in which testing is costly or presents safety risks. Apart from maintaining statistical validity, in applications such as online policy selection for offline reinforcement learning and prompt engineering, aLTT is shown to achieve the same performance as LTT while requiring only a fraction of the testing rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[APEX: Automated Parameter Exploration for Low-Power Wireless Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19194v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Careful parametrization of networking protocols is crucial to maximize the performance of low-power wireless systems and ensure that stringent application requirements can be met. This is a non-trivial task involving thorough characterization on testbeds and requiring expert knowledge. Unfortunately, the community still lacks a tool to facilitate parameter exploration while minimizing the necessary experimentation time on testbeds. Such a tool would be invaluable, as exhaustive parameter searches can be time-prohibitive or unfeasible given the limited availability of testbeds, whereas non-exhaustive unguided searches rarely deliver satisfactory results. In this paper, we present APEX, a framework enabling an automated and informed parameter exploration for low-power wireless protocols and allowing to converge to an optimal parameter set within a limited number of testbed trials. We design APEX using Gaussian processes to effectively handle noisy experimental data and estimate the optimality of a certain parameter combination. After developing a prototype of APEX, we demonstrate its effectiveness by parametrizing two IEEE 802.15.4 protocols for a wide range of application requirements. Our results show that APEX can return the best parameter set with up to 10.6x, 4.5x and 3.25x less testbed trials than traditional solutions based on exhaustive search, greedy approaches, and reinforcement learning, respectively.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |

A promising solution to this problem is using human-preference alignment techniques, such as best-of-n sampling and reinforcement learning. However, these techniques face the difficulty arising from the scarcity of visual preference data, which is required to train a visual reward model (VRM). In this work, we continue the line of research. We present a Robust Visual Reward Model (RoVRM) which improves human-preference alignment for LVLMs. RoVRM leverages auxiliary textual preference data through a three-phase progressive training and optimal transport-based preference data selection to effectively mitigate the scarcity of visual preference data. We experiment with RoVRM on the commonly used vision-language tasks based on the LLaVA-1.5-7B and -13B models. Experimental results demonstrate that RoVRM consistently outperforms traditional VRMs. Furthermore, our three-phase progressive training and preference data selection approaches can yield consistent performance gains over ranking-based alignment techniques, such as direct preference optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Smart Buildings Control Suite: A Diverse Open Source Benchmark to Evaluate and Scale HVAC Control Policies for Sustainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03756v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial buildings account for 17% of U.S. carbon emissions, with roughly half of that from Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC). HVAC devices form a complex thermodynamic system, and while Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning have been used to optimize control policies, scaling to thousands of buildings remains a significant unsolved challenge. Most current algorithms are over-optimized for specific buildings and rely on proprietary data or hard-to-configure simulations. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control benchmark with a focus on solutions that scale. It consists of 3 components: real-world telemetric data extracted from 11 buildings over 6 years, a lightweight data-driven simulator for each building, and a modular Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) building model as a simulator alternative. The buildings span a variety of climates, management systems, and sizes, and both the simulator and PINN easily scale to new buildings, ensuring solutions using this benchmark are robust to these factors and only reliant on fully scalable building models. This represents a major step towards scaling HVAC optimization from the lab to buildings everywhere. To facilitate use, our benchmark is compatible with the Gym standard, and our data is part of TensorFlow Datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Training Scaling for Chemical Exploration in Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19153v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical language models for molecular design have the potential to find solutions to multi-parameter optimization problems in drug discovery via reinforcement learning (RL). A key requirement to achieve this is the capacity to "search" chemical space to identify all molecules of interest. Here, we propose a challenging new benchmark to discover dissimilar molecules that possess similar bioactivity, a common scenario in drug discovery, but a hard problem to optimize. We show that a population of RL agents can solve the benchmark, while a single agent cannot. We also find that cooperative strategies are not significantly better than independent agents. Moreover, the performance on the benchmark scales log-linearly with the number of independent agents, showing a test-time training scaling law for chemical language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decorrelated Soft Actor-Critic for Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19133v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL) when dealing with high-dimensional data is influenced by the success of representation learning via deep neural networks, and has implications for the sample efficiency of deep RL algorithms. Input decorrelation has been previously introduced as a method to speed up optimization in neural networks, and has proven impactful in both efficient deep learning and as a method for effective representation learning for deep RL algorithms. We propose a novel approach to online decorrelation in deep RL based on the decorrelated backpropagation algorithm that seamlessly integrates the decorrelation process into the RL training pipeline. Decorrelation matrices are added to each layer, which are updated using a separate decorrelation learning rule that minimizes the total decorrelation loss across all layers, in parallel to minimizing the usual RL loss. We used our approach in combination with the soft actor-critic (SAC) method, which we refer to as decorrelated soft actor-critic (DSAC). Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark with DSAC shows, compared to the regular SAC baseline, faster training in five out of the seven games tested and improved reward performance in two games with around 50% reduction in wall-clock time, while maintaining performance levels on the other games. These results demonstrate the positive impact of network-wide decorrelation in deep RL for speeding up its sample efficiency through more effective credit assignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shaping Sparse Rewards in Reinforcement Learning: A Semi-supervised Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19128v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, our approach performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method effectively generalizes reward shaping to sparse reward scenarios, achieving up to four times better performance in reaching higher best scores compared to curiosity-driven methods. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm leverages additional state information available at training time for faster learning. Although the proposed learning objectives are usually theoretically sound, these methods still lack a theoretical justification for their potential benefits. We propose such a justification for asymmetric actor-critic algorithms with linear function approximators by adapting a finite-time convergence analysis to this setting. The resulting finite-time bound reveals that the asymmetric critic eliminates an error term arising from aliasing in the agent state.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 29 pages total</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models are In-context Preference Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17233v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning is an effective way to handle tasks where rewards are hard to specify but can be exceedingly inefficient as preference learning is often tabula rasa. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) have native preference-learning capabilities that allow them to achieve sample-efficient preference learning, addressing this challenge. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), which uses in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to reduce human query inefficiency. ICPL uses the task description and basic environment code to create sets of reward functions which are iteratively refined by placing human feedback over videos of the resultant policies into the context of an LLM and then requesting better rewards. We first demonstrate ICPL's effectiveness through a synthetic preference study, providing quantitative evidence that it significantly outperforms baseline preference-based methods with much higher performance and orders of magnitude greater efficiency. We observe that these improvements are not solely coming from LLM grounding in the task but that the quality of the rewards improves over time, indicating preference learning capabilities. Additionally, we perform a series of real human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.</p></details> |  |
| **[LNS2+RL: Combining Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Large Neighborhood Search in Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17794v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a critical component of logistics and warehouse management, which focuses on planning collision-free paths for a team of robots in a known environment. Recent work introduced a novel MAPF approach, LNS2, which proposed to repair a quickly obtained set of infeasible paths via iterative replanning, by relying on a fast, yet lower-quality, prioritized planning (PP) algorithm. At the same time, there has been a recent push for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based MAPF algorithms, which exhibit improved cooperation over such PP algorithms, although inevitably remaining slower. In this paper, we introduce a new MAPF algorithm, LNS2+RL, which combines the distinct yet complementary characteristics of LNS2 and MARL to effectively balance their individual limitations and get the best from both worlds. During early iterations, LNS2+RL relies on MARL for low-level replanning, which we show eliminates collisions much more than a PP algorithm. There, our MARL-based planner allows agents to reason about past and future information to gradually learn cooperative decision-making through a finely designed curriculum learning. At later stages of planning, LNS2+RL adaptively switches to PP algorithm to quickly resolve the remaining collisions, naturally trading off solution quality (number of collisions in the solution) and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on high-agent-density tasks across various team sizes, world sizes, and map structures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of LNS2+RL compared to many MAPF algorithms, including LNS2, LaCAM, EECBS, and SCRIMP. In maps with complex structures, the advantages of LNS2+RL are particularly pronounced, with LNS2+RL achieving a success rate of over 50% in nearly half of the tested tasks, while that of LaCAM, EECBS and SCRIMP falls to 0%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Computing equilibria in MFG has been of interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The theoretical guarantee that the last updated policy converges to an equilibrium has been limited. We propose the use of a simple, proximal-point (PP) type method to compute equilibria for MFGs. We then provide the first last-iterate convergence (LIC) guarantee under the Lasry--Lions-type monotonicity condition. We also propose an approximation of the update rule of PP ($\mathtt{APP}$) based on the observation that it is equivalent to solving the regularized MFG, which can be solved by mirror descent. We further establish that the regularized mirror descent achieves LIC at an exponential rate. Our numerical experiment demonstrates that $\mathtt{APP}$ efficiently computes the equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 26 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We show that, in this setting, the introduction of Differential Privacy can be reduced to the computation of appropriate trust regions, thus avoiding the sacrifice of theoretical properties of the DP-less methods. Therefore, we show that it is possible to find the right trade-off between privacy noise and trust-region size to obtain a performant differentially private policy gradient algorithm. We then outline its performance empirically on various benchmarks. Our results and the complexity of the tasks addressed represent a significant improvement over existing DP algorithms in online RL.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, we introduce the Double Threshold Spiking neuron model with adjustable thresholds to generate varied output patterns. This neuron model can excite the natural dynamics of soft robotic snakes, and it enables distinct movements, such as turning or moving forward, by simply altering the neural thresholds. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach, termed SpikingSoft, naturally pairs and integrates with reinforcement learning. The high-level agent only needs to adjust the two thresholds to generate complex movement patterns, thus strongly simplifying the learning of reactive locomotion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the performance of the soft snake robot, enabling it to achieve target objectives with a 21.6% increase in success rate, a 29% reduction in time to reach the target, and smoother movements compared to the vanilla reinforcement learning controllers or Central Pattern Generator controller acting in torque space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8th I...</summary><p>8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Job Allocation using Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19063v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient job allocation in complex scheduling problems poses significant challenges in real-world applications. In this report, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to tackle the Job Allocation Problem (JAP). The JAP involves allocating a maximum set of jobs to available resources while considering several constraints. Our approach enables learning of adaptive policies through trial-and-error interactions with the environment while exploiting the graph-structured data of the problem. By leveraging RL, we eliminate the need for manual annotation, a major bottleneck in supervised learning approaches. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach, outperforming baseline algorithms and showcasing its potential for optimizing job allocation in complex scheduling problems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Physiologically Sensible Predictions via the Rule-based Reinforcement Learning Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19055v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper adds to the growing literature of reinforcement learning (RL) for healthcare by proposing a novel paradigm: augmenting any predictor with Rule-based RL Layer (RRLL) that corrects the model's physiologically impossible predictions. Specifically, RRLL takes as input states predicted labels and outputs corrected labels as actions. The reward of the state-action pair is evaluated by a set of general rules. RRLL is efficient, general and lightweight: it does not require heavy expert knowledge like prior work but only a set of impossible transitions. This set is much smaller than all possible transitions; yet it can effectively reduce physiologically impossible mistakes made by the state-of-the-art predictor models. We verify the utility of RRLL on a variety of important healthcare classification problems and observe significant improvements using the same setup, with only the domain-specific set of impossibility changed. In-depth analysis shows that RRLL indeed improves accuracy by effectively reducing the presence of physiologically impossible predictions.</p></details> |  |

When prior knowledge of the domain or task is unavailable, training RL agents in unknown, \textit{black-box} environments presents an even greater safety risk. We introduce \mbox{ADVICE} (Adaptive Shielding with a Contrastive Autoencoder), a novel post-shielding technique that distinguishes safe and unsafe features of state-action pairs during training, and uses this knowledge to protect the RL agent from executing actions that yield likely hazardous outcomes. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art safe RL exploration techniques shows that ADVICE significantly reduces safety violations ($\approx\!\!50\%$) during training, with a competitive outcome reward compared to other techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Curse of Multiagency in Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20067v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are vulnerable to sim-to-real gaps. To address this, distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs) have been proposed to enhance robustness in MARL by optimizing the worst-case performance when game dynamics shift within a prescribed uncertainty set. RMGs remains under-explored, from reasonable problem formulation to the development of sample-efficient algorithms. Two notorious and open challenges are the formulation of the uncertainty set and whether the corresponding RMGs can overcome the curse of multiagency, where the sample complexity scales exponentially with the number of agents. In this work, we propose a natural class of RMGs inspired by behavioral economics, where each agent's uncertainty set is shaped by both the environment and the integrated behavior of other agents. We first establish the well-posedness of this class of RMGs by proving the existence of game-theoretic solutions such as robust Nash equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Assuming access to a generative model, we then introduce a sample-efficient algorithm for learning the CCE whose sample complexity scales polynomially with all relevant parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to break the curse of multiagency for RMGs, regardless of the uncertainty set formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic for Live Stream Allocation in Feed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10381v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to allocate at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream policy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream allocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and user retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream allocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which restricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial recommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Through theoretical analysis, we show that the Cauchy activation functions used in XNet can achieve arbitrary-order polynomial convergence, fundamentally outperforming traditional MLPs and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that rely on increased depth or B-spline activations. Our extensive experiments on function approximation, PDE solving, and reinforcement learning demonstrate XNet's superior performance - reducing approximation error by up to 50000 times and accelerating training by up to 10 times compared to existing approaches. These results establish XNet as a highly efficient architecture for both scientific computing and AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.02033</p></details> |
| **[Differentiable Simulation of Soft Robots with Frictional Contacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18956v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, soft robotics simulators have evolved to offer various functionalities, including the simulation of different material types (e.g., elastic, hyper-elastic) and actuation methods (e.g., pneumatic, cable-driven, servomotor). These simulators also provide tools for various tasks, such as calibration, design, and control. However, efficiently and accurately computing derivatives within these simulators remains a challenge, particularly in the presence of physical contact interactions. Incorporating these derivatives can, for instance, significantly improve the convergence speed of control methods like reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization, enable gradient-based techniques for design, or facilitate end-to-end machine-learning approaches for model reduction. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a unified method for computing the derivatives of mechanical equations within the finite element method framework, including contact interactions modeled as a nonlinear complementarity problem. The proposed approach handles both collision and friction phases, accounts for their nonsmooth dynamics, and leverages the sparsity introduced by mesh-based models. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through several examples of controlling and calibrating soft systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTPrompter: Weakly Supervised Automated Language Model Red-Teaming to Identify Low-Perplexity Toxic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09447v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional approaches for the automated red-teaming of large language models (LLMs) aim to identify prompts that elicit toxic outputs from a frozen language model (the defender). This often results in the prompting model (the adversary) producing text that is unlikely to arise during autoregression. In response, we propose a reinforcement learning formulation of LLM red-teaming designed to discover prompts that both (1) elicit toxic outputs from a defender and (2) have low perplexity as scored by that defender. These prompts are the most pertinent in a red-teaming setting because the defender generates them with high probability. We solve this formulation with an online and weakly supervised form of Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), attacking models ranging from 137M to 7.8B parameters. Our policy performs competitively, producing prompts that induce defender toxicity at a rate of 2-23 times higher than baseline across model scales. Importantly, these prompts have lower perplexity than both automatically generated and human-written attacks. Furthermore, our method creates black-box attacks with 5.4-14 times increased toxicity. To assess the downstream utility of our method, we use rollouts from our policy as negative examples for downstream toxicity tuning and demonstrate improved safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 pages of appendix, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

While prior single-agent studies have explored recovering reward functions and policies from human preferences, similar work in MARL is limited. Existing methods often involve separate stages of supervised reward learning and MARL algorithms, leading to unstable training. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end preference-based learning framework for cooperative MARL, leveraging the underlying connection between reward functions and soft Q-functions. Our approach uses a carefully-designed multi-agent value decomposition strategy to improve training efficiency. Extensive experiments on SMAC and MAMuJoCo benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to 1.34X speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes.</p></details> |  |

To this end, state-of-the-art quadrupeds with attached manipulators, such as the Boston Dynamics Spot, have emerged to provide a capable and robust platform. However, both the complexity of loco-manipulation control, as well as the black-box nature of commercial platforms pose challenges for developing accurate dynamics models and control policies. We address these challenges by developing a hand-crafted kinematic model for a quadruped-with-arm platform and, together with recent advances in Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)-based dynamics learning using physical priors, efficiently learn an accurate dynamics model from data. We then derive control policies for loco-manipulation via model-based reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on hardware using the Boston Dynamics Spot with a manipulator, accurately performing dynamic end-effector trajectory tracking even in low data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master Thesis at ETH Zurich</p></details> |

Effective inventory management is crucial in today's volatile and uncertain world. Previous research has demonstrated the superiority of heuristic methods and reinforcement learning applications in inventory management. However, the application of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in multi-agent systems for inventory management remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach using LLMs to manage multi-agent inventory systems. Leveraging their zero-shot learning capabilities, our model, InvAgent, enhances resilience and improves efficiency across the supply chain network. Our contributions include utilizing LLMs for zero-shot learning to enable adaptive and informed decision-making without prior training, providing explainability and clarity through chain-of-thought, and demonstrating dynamic adaptability to varying demand scenarios while reducing costs and preventing stockouts. Extensive evaluations across different scenarios highlight the efficiency of our model in SCM.</p></details> |  |

However, such fine-tuning relies heavily on high-quality datasets to achieve successful performance in various downstream tasks. Additionally, VLMs often encounter limitations due to insufficient and imbalanced fine-tuning data. To address these issues, we propose a new generalizable framework to improve VLM fine-tuning by integrating it with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our method utilizes the RL agent to manipulate objects within an indoor setting to create synthetic data for fine-tuning to address certain vulnerabilities of the VLM. Specifically, we use the performance of the VLM to provide feedback to the RL agent to generate informative data that efficiently fine-tune the VLM over the targeted task (e.g. spatial reasoning). The key contribution of this work is developing a framework where the RL agent serves as an informative data sampling tool and assists the VLM in order to enhance performance and address task-specific vulnerabilities. By targeting the data sampling process to address the weaknesses of the VLM, we can effectively train a more context-aware model. In addition, generating synthetic data allows us to have precise control over each scene and generate granular ground truth captions. Our results show that the proposed data generation approach improves the spatial reasoning performance of VLMs, which demonstrates the benefits of using RL-guided data generation in vision-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCPS...</summary><p>ICCPS 2025 accepted paper, 10 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Concurrent Learning with Aggregated States via Randomized Least Squares Value Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13394v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown 'competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Bandit Learning with Offline Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09574v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown `competence'. We propose $\mathsf{warmPref-PS}$, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the `competence' of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as, extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate loss function that optimizes for infinitely many arms, and performs substantially better (25 to 50\% regret reduction) than baselines.</p></details> |  |

We present a unified probabilistic framework that formalizes LLM reasoning through a novel graphical model incorporating latent thinking processes and evaluation signals. Within this framework, we introduce the Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process (BRiTE) algorithm, which works in two steps. First, it generates high-quality rationales by approximating the optimal thinking process through reinforcement learning, using a novel reward shaping mechanism. Second, it enhances the base LLM by maximizing the joint probability of rationale generation with respect to the model's parameters. Theoretically, we demonstrate BRiTE's convergence at a rate of $1/T$ with $T$ representing the number of iterations. Empirical evaluations on math and coding benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance across different base models without requiring human-annotated thinking processes. In addition, BRiTE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing algorithms that bootstrap thinking processes use alternative methods such as rejection sampling, and can even match or exceed the results achieved through supervised fine-tuning with human-annotated data.</p></details> |  |

Such instructions guide robots to accomplish diverse objectives and meet constraints through reinforcement learning (RL). Most existing methods are based on fixed mappings from environmental states to symbols. However, in inspection tasks, where equipment conditions must be evaluated from multiple perspectives to avoid errors of oversight, robots must fulfill the same symbol from different states. To help robots respond to flexible symbol mapping, we propose representing symbols and their mapping specifications separately within an RL policy. This approach imposes on RL policy to learn combinations of symbolic instructions and mapping specifications, requiring an efficient learning framework. To cope with this issue, we introduce an approach for learning flexible policies called Symbolic Instructions with Adjustable Mapping Specifications (SIAMS). This paper represents symbolic instructions using linear temporal logic (LTL), a formal language that can be easily integrated into RL. Our method addresses the diversified completion patterns of instructions by (1) a specification-aware state modulation, which embeds differences in mapping specifications in state features, and (2) a symbol-number-based task curriculum, which gradually provides tasks according to the learning's progress. Evaluations in 3D simulations with discrete and continuous action spaces demonstrate that our method outperforms context-aware multitask RL comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

In this paper, we design and develop the Infer-EDGE framework that seeks to strike such a balance for latency-sensitive video processing applications. First, using comprehensive benchmarking experiments, we develop intuitions about the trade-off characteristics, which are then used by the framework to develop an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach that can choose optimal run-time DNN inference parameters aligning the performance metrics based on the application requirements. Using real-world DNNs and a hardware testbed, we evaluate the benefits of the Infer-EDGE framework in terms of device energy savings, inference accuracy improvement, and end-to-end inference latency reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.12221</p></details> |

Therefore, in this work we present a deceptive decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but in fact actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, and we consider adversaries that attempt to infer their reward functions using inverse reinforcement learning. To counter such efforts, we present two regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's underlying rewards. The first form of deception is ``diversionary'', and it leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about what the system's reward function is. The second form of deception is ``targeted'', and it leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about what the system's reward function is. We then show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems, and we analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward that is induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent sequential decision-making problem with one real agent and multiple decoys. We show that diversionary deception can cause the adversary to believe that the most important agent is the least important, while attaining a total accumulated reward that is $98.83\%$ of its optimal, non-deceptive value. Similarly, we show that targeted deception can make any decoy appear to be the most important agent, while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is $99.25\%$ of its optimal, non-deceptive value.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

Previous efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural modifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with Transformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of SSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities.

However, the integration of these advanced algorithms poses significant challenges, especially concerning safety and reliability. This research emphasizes the importance of incorporating human-machine collaboration into the systems engineering process to design learning-enabled increasingly autonomous systems (LEIAS). Our proposed LEIAS architecture emphasizes communication representation and pilot preference learning to boost operational safety. Leveraging the Soar cognitive architecture, the system merges symbolic decision logic with numeric decision preferences enhanced through reinforcement learning. A core aspect of this approach is transparency; the LEIAS provides pilots with a comprehensive, interpretable view of the system's state, encompassing detailed evaluations of sensor reliability, including GPS, IMU, and LIDAR data. This multi-sensor assessment is critical for diagnosing discrepancies and maintaining trust. Additionally, the system learns and adapts to pilot preferences, enabling responsive, context-driven decision-making. Autonomy is incrementally escalated based on necessity, ensuring pilots retain control in standard scenarios and receive assistance only when required.
