| **[Ola: Pushing the Frontiers of Omni-Modal Language Model with Progressive Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04328v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.</p></details> |  |

While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChamaleonLLM: Batch-Aware Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Inference-Time Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04315v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChamaleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChamaleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference. ChamaleonLLM is open-sourced to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChamaleonLLM/</p></details> |  |
| **[ScoreFlow: Mastering LLM Agent Workflows via Score-based Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04306v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has leveraged large language model multi-agent systems for complex problem-solving while trying to reduce the manual effort required to build them, driving the development of automated agent workflow optimization methods. However, existing methods remain inflexible due to representational limitations, a lack of adaptability, and poor scalability when relying on discrete optimization techniques. We address these challenges with ScoreFlow, a simple yet high-performance framework that leverages efficient gradient-based optimization in a continuous space. ScoreFlow incorporates Score-DPO, a novel variant of the direct preference optimization method that accounts for quantitative feedback. Across six benchmarks spanning question answering, coding, and mathematical reasoning, ScoreFlow achieves an 8.2% improvement over existing baselines. Moreover, it empowers smaller models to outperform larger ones with lower inference costs.

| **[Beyond Prompt Content: Enhancing LLM Performance via Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04295v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant capability across various tasks, with their real-world effectiveness often driven by prompt design. While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/HenryLau7/CFPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advantage Alignment Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14662v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificially intelligent agents are increasingly being integrated into human decision-making: from large language model (LLM) assistants to autonomous vehicles. These systems often optimize their individual objective, leading to conflicts, particularly in general-sum games where naive reinforcement learning agents empirically converge to Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria. To address this issue, opponent shaping has emerged as a paradigm for finding socially beneficial equilibria in general-sum games. In this work, we introduce Advantage Alignment, a family of algorithms derived from first principles that perform opponent shaping efficiently and intuitively. We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive. We prove that existing opponent shaping methods implicitly perform Advantage Alignment. Compared to these methods, Advantage Alignment simplifies the mathematical formulation of opponent shaping, reduces the computational burden and extends to continuous action domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across a range of social dilemmas, achieving state-of-the-art cooperation and robustness against exploitation.</p></details> | 25 Pages, 8 figures |
| **[PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04270v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Efficient Long Context Language Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06067v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in language processing applications. However, due to the memory constraints of the devices, most of them restrict the context window. Even though recurrent models in previous works can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context and maintain effectiveness, they have ``flat'' memory architectures. Such architectures have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are good at learning and self-adjustment, we believe that imitating brain memory hierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. Thus, we propose the Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that facilitates a model's long-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior. Leveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory hierarchy by preserving tokens from early input segments, passing memory embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history. Evaluating general language modeling, question-answering tasks, and the summarization task, we show that HMT consistently improves the long-context processing ability of existing models. Furthermore, HMT achieves a comparable or superior generation quality to long-context LLMs with $2 \sim 57\times$ fewer parameters and $2.5 \sim 116\times$ less inference memory, significantly outperforming previous memory-augmented models.

| **[A Parameter-Efficient Tuning Framework for Language-guided Object Grounding and Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19457v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The language-guided robot grasping task requires a robot agent to integrate multimodal information from both visual and linguistic inputs to predict actions for target-driven grasping. While recent approaches utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, their extensive computation and data demands limit the feasibility of local deployment and customization. To address this, we propose a novel CLIP-based multimodal parameter-efficient tuning (PET) framework designed for three language-guided object grounding and grasping tasks: (1) Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), (2) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS), and (3) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA). Our approach introduces two key innovations: a bi-directional vision-language adapter that aligns multimodal inputs for pixel-level language understanding and a depth fusion branch that incorporates geometric cues to facilitate robot grasping predictions. Experiment results demonstrate superior performance in the RES object grounding task compared with existing CLIP-based full-model tuning or PET approaches. In the RGS and RGA tasks, our model not only effectively interprets object attributes based on simple language descriptions but also shows strong potential for comprehending complex spatial reasoning scenarios, such as multiple identical objects present in the workspace.

| **[MAGA: MAssive Genre-Audience Reformulation to Pretraining Corpus Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04235v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models across various tasks, their continued scaling faces a critical challenge: the scarcity of high-quality pretraining data. While model architectures continue to evolve, the natural language data struggles to scale up. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose \textbf{MA}ssive \textbf{G}enre-\textbf{A}udience~(MAGA) reformulation method, which systematic synthesizes diverse, contextually-rich pretraining data from existing corpus. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We propose MAGA reformulation method, a lightweight and scalable approach for pretraining corpus expansion, and build a 770B tokens MAGACorpus. (2) We evaluate MAGACorpus with different data budget scaling strategies, demonstrating consistent improvements across various model sizes (134M-13B), establishing the necessity for next-generation large-scale synthetic pretraining language models. (3) Through comprehensive analysis, we investigate prompt engineering's impact on synthetic training collapse and reveal limitations in conventional collapse detection metrics using validation losses. Our work shows that MAGA can substantially expand training datasets while maintaining quality, offering a reliably pathway for scaling models beyond data limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset released url https://huggingface.co/datasets/bytedance-research/MAGACorpus</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLM-driven autonomous systems for Assumed Breach penetration testing in enterprise networks. We introduce a novel prototype that, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), can compromise accounts within a real-life Active Directory testbed. Our research provides a comprehensive evaluation of the prototype's capabilities, and highlights both strengths and limitations while executing attack. The evaluation uses a realistic simulation environment (Game of Active Directory, GOAD) to capture intricate interactions, stochastic outcomes, and timing dependencies that characterize live network scenarios. The study concludes that autonomous LLMs are able to conduct Assumed Breach simulations, potentially democratizing access to penetration testing for organizations facing budgetary constraints. The prototype's source code, traces, and analyzed logs are released as open-source to enhance collective cybersecurity and facilitate future research in LLM-driven cybersecurity automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keep It Light! Simplifying Image Clustering Via Text-Free Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04226v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many competitive clustering pipelines have a multi-modal design, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or other text encoders, and text-image pairs, which are often unavailable in real-world downstream applications. Additionally, such frameworks are generally complicated to train and require substantial computational resources, making widespread adoption challenging. In this work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more complex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly simplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering via Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging pre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs. Experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result explaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based embeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Éclair -- Extracting Content and Layout with Integrated Reading Order for Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04223v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is widely used to extract text from images of documents, facilitating efficient digitization and data retrieval. However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sports and Women's Sports: Gender Bias in Text Generation with Olympic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04218v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be biased in prior work, as they generate text that is in line with stereotypical views of the world or that is not representative of the viewpoints and values of historically marginalized demographic groups. In this work, we propose using data from parallel men's and women's events at the Olympic Games to investigate different forms of gender bias in language models. We define three metrics to measure bias, and find that models are consistently biased against women when the gender is ambiguous in the prompt. In this case, the model frequently retrieves only the results of the men's event with or without acknowledging them as such, revealing pervasive gender bias in LLMs in the context of athletics.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[Algorithmic causal structure emerging through compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04210v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.</p></details> |  |
| **["Short-length" Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend "Long-length" Jailbreak Attacks: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04204v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Best Instruction-Tuning Data are Those That Fit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04194v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training. We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04192v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. Such approaches have shown strong performance on benchmarks for referring expression segmentation and grounded conversation generation. The current trend in pixel-level MLLMs is to train with pixel-level grounding supervision on large-scale labelled data. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering. Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks and show that MLLMs without pixel-level grounding supervision can outperform the state of the art in such tasks when evaluating both the pixel-level grounding and visual question answering. We propose simple baselines to extract the grounding information that can be plugged into any MLLM, which we call as PixFoundation. More importantly, we study the research question of ``When does grounding emerge in MLLMs that are not trained with pixel-level grounding supervision?'' We show that grounding can coincide with object parts or location/appearance information. Code repository is at https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation/.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Automated Microservice Pattern Instance Detection Using Infrastructure-as-Code Artifacts and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04188v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Documenting software architecture is essential to preserve architecture knowledge, even though it is frequently costly. Architecture pattern instances, including microservice pattern instances, provide important structural software information. Practitioners should document this information to prevent knowledge vaporization. However, architecture patterns may not be detectable by analyzing source code artifacts, requiring the analysis of other types of artifacts. Moreover, many existing pattern detection instance approaches are complex to extend. This article presents our ongoing PhD research, early experiments, and a prototype for a tool we call MicroPAD for automating the detection of microservice pattern instances. The prototype uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) artifacts to aid detection, aiming to keep costs low and maximize the scope of detectable patterns. Early experiments ran the prototype thrice in 22 GitHub projects. We verified that 83\% of the patterns that the prototype identified were in the project. The costs of detecting the pattern instances were minimal. These results indicate that the approach is likely viable and, by lowering the entry barrier to automating pattern instance detection, could help democratize developer access to this category of architecture knowledge. Finally, we present our overall research methodology, planned future work, and an overview of MicroPAD's potential industrial impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICSA ...</summary><p>ICSA 2025 - International Conference on Software Architecture. 6 pages</p></details> |
| **[Multi-agent Architecture Search via Agentic Supernet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04180v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered multi-agent systems extend the cognitive boundaries of individual agents through disciplined collaboration and interaction, while constructing these systems often requires labor-intensive manual designs. Despite the availability of methods to automate the design of agentic workflows, they typically seek to identify a static, complex, one-size-fits-all system, which, however, fails to dynamically allocate inference resources based on the difficulty and domain of each query. To address this challenge, we shift away from the pursuit of a monolithic agentic system, instead optimizing the \textbf{agentic supernet}, a probabilistic and continuous distribution of agentic architectures. We introduce MaAS, an automated framework that samples query-dependent agentic systems from the supernet, delivering high-quality solutions and tailored resource allocation (\textit{e.g.}, LLM calls, tool calls, token cost). Comprehensive evaluation across six benchmarks demonstrates that MaAS \textbf{(I)} requires only $6\sim45\%$ of the inference costs of existing handcrafted or automated multi-agent systems, \textbf{(II)} surpasses them by $0.54\%\sim11.82\%$, and \textbf{(III)} enjoys superior cross-dataset and cross-LLM-backbone transferability.</p></details> |  |

Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging large language models to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main road. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the advanced nature of this evaluation benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues.

Probing LLMs for Food-related Cultural Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06833v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have highlighted the presence of cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet often lack a robust methodology to dissect these phenomena comprehensively. Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the Food domain, a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce FmLAMA, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs' ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>cultu...</summary><p>cultural bias analysis, cultural knowledge probing, large language models, cultural NLP; Accepted by NAACL2025</p></details> |

However, most prior evaluation benchmarks have been devoted to validating pairwise matching correctness, ignoring the crucial measurement of robustness. In this paper, we present the first benchmark that simulates the evaluation of open information extraction models in the real world, where the syntactic and expressive distributions under the same knowledge meaning may drift variously. We design and annotate a large-scale testbed in which each example is a knowledge-invariant clique that consists of sentences with structured knowledge of the same meaning but with different syntactic and expressive forms. By further elaborating the robustness metric, a model is judged to be robust if its performance is consistently accurate on the overall cliques. We perform experiments on typical models published in the last decade as well as a popular large language model, the results show that the existing successful models exhibit a frustrating degradation, with a maximum drop of 23.43 F1 score.

| **[UltraIF: Advancing Instruction Following from the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04153v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method.

Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security Weaknesses of Copilot-Generated Code in GitHub Projects: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02059v4)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code generation tools utilizing AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their ability to produce functional code. However, their usage presents security challenges, often resulting in insecure code merging into the code base. Thus, evaluating the quality of generated code, especially its security, is crucial. While prior research explored various aspects of code generation, the focus on security has been limited, mostly examining code produced in controlled environments rather than open source development scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study, analyzing code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot and two other AI code generation tools (i.e., CodeWhisperer and Codeium) from GitHub projects. Our analysis identified 733 snippets, revealing a high likelihood of security weaknesses, with 29.5% of Python and 24.2% of JavaScript snippets affected. These issues span 43 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, including significant ones like CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code, and CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting. Notably, eight of those CWEs are among the 2023 CWE Top-25, highlighting their severity. We further examined using Copilot Chat to fix security issues in Copilot-generated code by providing Copilot Chat with warning messages from the static analysis tools, and up to 55.5% of the security issues can be fixed. We finally provide the suggestions for mitigating security issues in generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Order Effect: Investigating Prompt Sensitivity in Closed-Source LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04134v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to diverse applications, ensuring their reliability under varying input conditions is crucial. One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in closed-source LLMs by conducting experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation, however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first 3 authors have contributed equally</p></details> |

However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, several significant challenges still persist in LLMs for ranking: (1) LLMs are constrained by limited input length, precluding them from processing a large number of documents simultaneously; (2) The output document sequence is influenced by the input order of documents, resulting in inconsistent ranking outcomes; (3) Achieving a balance between cost and ranking performance is challenging. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel documents ranking method called TourRank, which is inspired by the sport tournaments, such as FIFA World Cup. Specifically, we 1) overcome the limitation in input length and reduce the ranking latency by incorporating a multi-stage grouping strategy similar to the parallel group stage of sport tournaments; 2) improve the ranking performance and robustness to input orders by using a points system to ensemble multiple ranking results. We test TourRank with different LLMs on the TREC DL datasets and the BEIR benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that TourRank delivers state-of-the-art performance at a modest cost. The code of TourRank can be seen on https://github.com/chenyiqun/TourRank.</p></details> |  |

| **[LLMs to Support a Domain Specific Knowledge Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04095v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a custom approach to developing a domain specific knowledge assistant for sustainability reporting using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In this domain, there is no publicly available question-answer dataset, which has impeded the development of a high-quality chatbot to support companies with IFRS reporting. The two key contributions of this project therefore are: (1) A high-quality synthetic question-answer (QA) dataset based on IFRS sustainability standards, created using a novel generation and evaluation pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This comprises 1,063 diverse QA pairs that address a wide spectrum of potential user queries in sustainability reporting. Various LLM-based techniques are employed to create the dataset, including chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. A custom evaluation framework is developed to assess question and answer quality across multiple dimensions, including faithfulness, relevance, and domain specificity. The dataset averages a score range of 8.16 out of 10 on these metrics. (2) Two architectures for question-answering in the sustainability reporting domain - a RAG pipeline and a fully LLM-based pipeline. The architectures are developed by experimenting, fine-tuning, and training on the QA dataset. The final pipelines feature an LLM fine-tuned on domain specific data and an industry classification component to improve the handling of complex queries. The RAG architecture achieves an accuracy of 85.32% on single-industry and 72.15% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, outperforming the baseline approach by 4.67 and 19.21 percentage points, respectively. The LLM-based pipeline achieves an accuracy of 93.45% on single-industry and 80.30% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, an improvement of 12.80 and 27.36 percentage points over the baseline, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiSHA: Dimension-Sharding Adaptation of Large Language Models with Fast Convergence and Fast Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15371v8)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent technique within the framework of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), efficiently reduces the computational burden associated with adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, thereby enabling resource-constrained fine-tuning. However, existing researches have shown that LoRA suffers from slow convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Dimension-Sharding Adaptation (DiSHA), which expands the PEFT design space to even fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence. Within DiSHA's design space, we propose Block Affine Efficient Computation (Bone), a computationally efficient structure that delivers both high performance and efficiency. While certain DiSHA configurations may result in colinear updates to weight shards, we address this with Block Affine Transformation (Bat), a nonlinear variant of DiSHA. Bat introduces nonlinearity by combining trainable matrices with original weight shards in a nonlinear manner, inducing nonlinearity in matrix updates without introducing additional parameters. Empirical results show that Bone, under the DiSHA framework, consistently outperforms LoRA variants in both Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation tasks, with significantly improved computational efficiency. Further analysis demonstrates that BAT enhances model capabilities by leveraging its nonlinear design.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttentionPredictor: Temporal Pattern Matters for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04077v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Large Language Model Capabilities on Closed-Book QA Tasks Using Only Information Available Prior to Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04066v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The GPT-4 technical report from OpenAI suggests that model performance on specific tasks can be predicted prior to training, though methodologies remain unspecified. This approach is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring data alignment with target tasks. To achieve this vision, we focus on predicting performance on Closed-book Question Answering (CBQA) tasks, which are closely tied to pre-training data and knowledge retention. We address three major challenges: 1) mastering the entire pre-training process, especially data construction; 2) evaluating a model's knowledge retention; and 3) predicting task-specific knowledge retention using only information available prior to training. To tackle these challenges, we pre-train three large language models (i.e., 1.6B, 7B, and 13B) using 560k dollars and 520k GPU hours. We analyze the pre-training data with knowledge triples and assess knowledge retention using established methods. Additionally, we introduce the SMI metric, an information-theoretic measure that quantifies the relationship between pre-training data, model size, and task-specific knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal a strong linear correlation ($\text{R}^2 > 0.84$) between the SMI metric and the model's accuracy on CBQA tasks across models of varying sizes (i.e., 1.1B, 1.6B, 7B, and 13B). The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/yuhui1038/SMI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Root Defence Strategies: Ensuring Safety of LLM at the Decoding Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06809v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Exploring Imbalanced Annotations for Effective In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04037v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks through in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the demonstrations selected from annotated datasets. Existing selection methods may hinge on the distribution of annotated datasets, which can often be long-tailed in real-world scenarios. In this work, we show that imbalanced class distributions in annotated datasets significantly degrade the performance of ICL across various tasks and selection methods. Moreover, traditional rebalance methods fail to ameliorate the issue of class imbalance in ICL. Our method is motivated by decomposing the distributional differences between annotated and test datasets into two-component weights: class-wise weights and conditional bias. The key idea behind our method is to estimate the conditional bias by minimizing the empirical error on a balanced validation dataset and to employ the two-component weights to modify the original scoring functions during selection. Our approach can prevent selecting too many demonstrations from a single class while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average accuracy by up to 5.46 on common benchmarks with imbalanced datasets.</p></details> |  |

Quantitative knowledge retrieval from large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07770v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively studied for their abilities to generate convincing natural language sequences, however their utility for quantitative information retrieval is less well understood. Here we explore the feasibility of LLMs as a mechanism for quantitative knowledge retrieval to aid two data analysis tasks: elicitation of prior distributions for Bayesian models and imputation of missing data. We introduce a framework that leverages LLMs to enhance Bayesian workflows by eliciting expert-like prior knowledge and imputing missing data. Tested on diverse datasets, this approach can improve predictive accuracy and reduce data requirements, offering significant potential in healthcare, environmental science and engineering applications. We discuss the implications and challenges of treating LLMs as 'experts'.</p></details> |  |

One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces Echo-Teddy, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based social robot designed to support autistic students in developing social and communication skills. Unlike previous chatbot-based solutions, Echo-Teddy leverages advanced LLM capabilities to provide more natural and adaptive interactions. The research addresses two key questions: (1) What are the design principles and initial prototype characteristics of an effective LLM-based social robot for autistic students? (2) What improvements can be made based on developer reflection-on-action and expert interviews? The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining prototype development with qualitative analysis of developer reflections and expert interviews. Key design principles identified include customizability, ethical considerations, and age-appropriate interactions. The initial prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi platform, features custom speech components and basic motor functions. Evaluation of the prototype revealed potential improvements in areas such as user interface, educational value, and practical implementation in educational settings. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted special education by demonstrating the potential of LLM-based social robots in supporting autistic students. The findings provide valuable insights for future developments in accessible and effective social support tools for special education.</p></details> |  |

The reliance on retrieval alone proves insufficient for extracting deep, domain-specific knowledge performing in logical reasoning from specialized corpora. To address this, we introduce sPecIalized KnowledgE and Rationale Augmentation Generation (PIKE-RAG), focusing on extracting, understanding, and applying specialized knowledge, while constructing coherent rationale to incrementally steer LLMs toward accurate responses. Recognizing the diverse challenges of industrial tasks, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies tasks based on their complexity in knowledge extraction and application, allowing for a systematic evaluation of RAG systems' problem-solving capabilities. This strategic approach offers a roadmap for the phased development and enhancement of RAG systems, tailored to meet the evolving demands of industrial applications. Furthermore, we propose knowledge atomizing and knowledge-aware task decomposition to effectively extract multifaceted knowledge from the data chunks and iteratively construct the rationale based on original query and the accumulated knowledge, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, technique report</p></details> |

A recent class of neural network models gaining increasing popularity is structured state space models (SSMs), regarded as an efficient alternative to transformers. Prior work argued that the implicit bias of SSMs leads to generalization in a setting where data is generated by a low dimensional teacher. In this paper, we revisit the latter setting, and formally establish a phenomenon entirely undetected by prior work on the implicit bias of SSMs. Namely, we prove that while implicit bias leads to generalization under many choices of training data, there exist special examples whose inclusion in training completely distorts the implicit bias, to a point where generalization fails. This failure occurs despite the special training examples being labeled by the teacher, i.e. having clean labels! We empirically demonstrate the phenomenon, with SSMs trained independently and as part of non-linear neural networks. In the area of adversarial machine learning, disrupting generalization with cleanly labeled training examples is known as clean-label poisoning. Given the proliferation of SSMs, particularly in large language models, we believe significant efforts should be invested in further delineating their susceptibility to clean-label poisoning, and in developing methods for overcoming this susceptibility.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is inherently complex, requiring the alignment and coordination of API systems, communication protocols, and even vehicle simulation systems to develop valid test cases. In practical industrial scenarios, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and interdependencies across various documents and system specifications pose significant challenges. This paper presents a system designed for the automated testing of in-vehicle APIs. By clearly defining and segmenting the testing process, we enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a stable and controlled testing workflow. Experiments conducted on over 100 APIs demonstrate that our system effectively automates vehicle API testing. The results also confirm that LLMs can efficiently handle mundane tasks requiring human judgment, making them suitable for complete automation in similar industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2025</p></details> |

Current work primarily applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model for recommendation tasks. However, SFT on positive examples only limits the model's ability to align with user preference. To address this, researchers recently introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which explicitly aligns LLMs with user preferences using offline preference ranking data. However, we found that DPO inherently biases the model towards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately degrading user experience. In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play framework designed to mitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional data or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes an SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as positive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as negative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the model's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate SPRec's effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy and fairness. The implementation is available via https://github.com/RegionCh/SPRec</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models, however, interpret the purpose and key information of user's input to enable responsive interactions. Existing NLU models generally map individual utterances to a dual-level semantic frame, involving sentence-level intent and word-level slot labels. However, real-life conversations primarily consist of multi-turn conversations, involving the interpretation of complex and extended dialogues. Researchers encounter challenges addressing all facets of multi-turn dialogue conversations using a unified single NLU model. This paper introduces a novel approach, MIDAS, leveraging a multi-level intent, domain, and slot knowledge distillation for multi-turn NLU. To achieve this, we construct distinct teachers for varying levels of conversation knowledge, namely, sentence-level intent detection, word-level slot filling, and conversation-level domain classification. These teachers are then fine-tuned to acquire specific knowledge of their designated levels. A multi-teacher loss is proposed to facilitate the combination of these multi-level teachers, guiding a student model in multi-turn dialogue tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in improving the overall multi-turn conversation understanding, showcasing the potential for advancements in NLU models through the incorporation of multi-level dialogue knowledge distillation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through various experiments, including zero-shot downstream tasks, long-context tasks, and ablation studies, we demonstrate that \texttt{MacDrop} generally improves performance and strengthens robustness.</p></details> | Under review |

Due to the heterogeneity of the underlying graph schema, topology and assertions, most KGQA systems cannot be transferred to unseen Knowledge Graphs (KGs) without resource-intensive training data. We present OntoSCPrompt, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based KGQA approach with a two-stage architecture that separates semantic parsing from KG-dependent interactions. OntoSCPrompt first generates a SPARQL query structure (including SPARQL keywords such as SELECT, ASK, WHERE and placeholders for missing tokens) and then fills them with KG-specific information. To enhance the understanding of the underlying KG, we present an ontology-guided, hybrid prompt learning strategy that integrates KG ontology into the learning process of hybrid prompts (e.g., discrete and continuous vectors). We also present several task-specific decoding strategies to ensure the correctness and executability of generated SPARQL queries in both stages. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoSCPrompt performs as well as SOTA approaches without retraining on a number of KGQA datasets such as CWQ, WebQSP and LC-QuAD 1.0 in a resource-efficient manner and can generalize well to unseen domain-specific KGs like DBLP-QuAD and CoyPu KG Code: \href{https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt}{https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By ICSC 2025</p></details> |

Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based solutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this paper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first algorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social navigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified uncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide the behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This integration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle safety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method achieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous state-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8 times fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our approach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based navigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate robust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. The video demos can be found on our project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/; 16 pages</p></details> |

Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two strategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real reinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for humans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without touch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and involves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key insight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while humans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon tasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both approaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to pretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or translation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous foundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a prompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that it is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous manipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured as duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we demonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object reorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zhaohengyin.github.io/dexteritygen</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Advantage Alignment Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14662v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificially intelligent agents are increasingly being integrated into human decision-making: from large language model (LLM) assistants to autonomous vehicles. These systems often optimize their individual objective, leading to conflicts, particularly in general-sum games where naive reinforcement learning agents empirically converge to Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria. To address this issue, opponent shaping has emerged as a paradigm for finding socially beneficial equilibria in general-sum games. In this work, we introduce Advantage Alignment, a family of algorithms derived from first principles that perform opponent shaping efficiently and intuitively. We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive. We prove that existing opponent shaping methods implicitly perform Advantage Alignment. Compared to these methods, Advantage Alignment simplifies the mathematical formulation of opponent shaping, reduces the computational burden and extends to continuous action domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across a range of social dilemmas, achieving state-of-the-art cooperation and robustness against exploitation.</p></details> | 25 Pages, 8 figures |
| **[PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04270v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reward Alignment via Hypothesis Space Batch Cutting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02921v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward design for reinforcement learning and optimal control agents is challenging. Preference-based alignment addresses this by enabling agents to learn rewards from ranked trajectory pairs provided by humans. However, existing methods often struggle from poor robustness to unknown false human preferences. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient reward alignment method based on a novel and geometrically interpretable perspective: hypothesis space batched cutting. Our method iteratively refines the reward hypothesis space through "cuts" based on batches of human preferences. Within each batch, human preferences, queried based on disagreement, are grouped using a voting function to determine the appropriate cut, ensuring a bounded human query complexity. To handle unknown erroneous preferences, we introduce a conservative cutting method within each batch, preventing erroneous human preferences from making overly aggressive cuts to the hypothesis space. This guarantees provable robustness against false preferences. We evaluate our method in a model predictive control setting across diverse tasks, including DM-Control, dexterous in-hand manipulation, and locomotion. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in error-free settings while significantly outperforming existing method when handling high percentage of erroneous human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, including appendix</p></details> |
| **[Behavioral Entropy-Guided Dataset Generation for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04141v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy-based objectives are widely used to perform state space exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) and dataset generation for offline RL. Behavioral entropy (BE), a rigorous generalization of classical entropies that incorporates cognitive and perceptual biases of agents, was recently proposed for discrete settings and shown to be a promising metric for robotic exploration problems. In this work, we propose using BE as a principled exploration objective for systematically generating datasets that provide diverse state space coverage in complex, continuous, potentially high-dimensional domains. To achieve this, we extend the notion of BE to continuous settings, derive tractable $k$-nearest neighbor estimators, provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, and develop practical reward functions that can be used with standard RL methods to learn BE-maximizing policies. Using standard MuJoCo environments, we experimentally compare the performance of offline RL algorithms for a variety of downstream tasks on datasets generated using BE, R\'{e}nyi, and Shannon entropy-maximizing policies, as well as the SMM and RND algorithms. We find that offline RL algorithms trained on datasets collected using BE outperform those trained on datasets collected using Shannon entropy, SMM, and RND on all tasks considered, and on 80% of the tasks compared to datasets collected using R\'{e}nyi entropy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[PACE: Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20120v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central but unresolved aspect of problem-solving in AI is the capability to introduce and use abstractions, something humans excel at. Work in cognitive science has demonstrated that humans tend towards higher levels of abstraction when engaged in collaborative task-oriented communication, enabling gradually shorter and more information-efficient utterances. Several computational methods have attempted to replicate this phenomenon, but all make unrealistic simplifying assumptions about how abstractions are introduced and learned. Our method, Procedural Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently (PACE), overcomes these limitations through a neuro-symbolic approach. On the symbolic side, we draw on work from library learning for proposing abstractions. We combine this with neural methods for communication and reinforcement learning, via a novel use of bandit algorithms for controlling the exploration and exploitation trade-off in introducing new abstractions. PACE exhibits similar tendencies to humans on a collaborative construction task from the cognitive science literature, where one agent (the architect) instructs the other (the builder) to reconstruct a scene of block-buildings. PACE results in the emergence of an efficient language as a by-product of collaborative communication. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into human communication, our work serves as a first step to providing conversational agents with the ability for human-like communicative abstractions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |
| **[MA4DIV: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Search Result Diversification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17421v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search result diversification (SRD), which aims to ensure that documents in a ranking list cover a broad range of subtopics, is a significant and widely studied problem in Information Retrieval and Web Search. Existing methods primarily utilize a paradigm of "greedy selection", i.e., selecting one document with the highest diversity score at a time or optimize an approximation of the objective function. These approaches tend to be inefficient and are easily trapped in a suboptimal state. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for search result DIVersity, which called MA4DIV. In this approach, each document is an agent and the search result diversification is modeled as a cooperative task among multiple agents. By modeling the SRD ranking problem as a cooperative MARL problem, this approach allows for directly optimizing the diversity metrics, such as $\alpha$-NDCG, while achieving high training efficiency. We conducted experiments on public TREC datasets and a larger scale dataset in the industrial setting. The experiemnts show that MA4DIV achieves substantial improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency than existing baselines, especially on the industrial dataset. The code of MA4DIV can be seen on https://github.com/chenyiqun/MA4DIV.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic-Q: Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading via Program Sketch-based Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05551v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionized quantitative trading (Q-trading) by achieving decent performance without significant human expert knowledge. Despite its achievements, we observe that the current state-of-the-art DRL models are still ineffective in identifying the market trends, causing them to miss good trading opportunities or suffer from large drawdowns when encountering market crashes. To address this limitation, a natural approach is to incorporate human expert knowledge in identifying market trends. Whereas, such knowledge is abstract and hard to be quantified. In order to effectively leverage abstract human expert knowledge, in this paper, we propose a universal logic-guided deep reinforcement learning framework for Q-trading, called Logic-Q. In particular, Logic-Q adopts the program synthesis by sketching paradigm and introduces a logic-guided model design that leverages a lightweight, plug-and-play market trend-aware program sketch to determine the market trend and correspondingly adjusts the DRL policy in a post-hoc manner. Extensive evaluations of two popular quantitative trading tasks demonstrate that Logic-Q can significantly improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art DRL trading strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

| **[Simulating the Emergence of Differential Case Marking with Communicating Neural-Network Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04038v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Case Marking (DCM) refers to the phenomenon where grammatical case marking is applied selectively based on semantic, pragmatic, or other factors. The emergence of DCM has been studied in artificial language learning experiments with human participants, which were specifically aimed at disentangling the effects of learning from those of communication (Smith & Culbertson, 2020). Multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks based on neural networks have gained significant interest to simulate the emergence of human-like linguistic phenomena. In this study, we employ such a framework in which agents first acquire an artificial language before engaging in communicative interactions, enabling direct comparisons to human result. Using a very generic communication optimization algorithm and neural-network learners that have no prior experience with language or semantic preferences, our results demonstrate that learning alone does not lead to DCM, but when agents communicate, differential use of markers arises. This supports Smith and Culbertson (2020)'s findings that highlight the critical role of communication in shaping DCM and showcases the potential of neural-agent models to complement experimental research on language evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tractable Inference Perspective of Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00094v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks is to first fit the offline trajectories to a sequence model, and then prompt the model for actions that lead to high expected return. In addition to obtaining accurate sequence models, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an important role in offline RL. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates significantly undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves the most state-of-the-art scores in 9 Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, owing to its tractability, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks (e.g. with action constraints) with minimum algorithmic modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Meta Coordination Graphs for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04028v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents deep meta coordination graphs (DMCG) for learning cooperative policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Coordination graph formulations encode local interactions and accordingly factorize the joint value function of all agents to improve efficiency in MARL. However, existing approaches rely solely on pairwise relations between agents, which potentially oversimplifies complex multi-agent interactions. DMCG goes beyond these simple direct interactions by also capturing useful higher-order and indirect relationships among agents. It generates novel graph structures accommodating multiple types of interactions and arbitrary lengths of multi-hop connections in coordination graphs to model such interactions. It then employs a graph convolutional network module to learn powerful representations in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multiple coordination problems in MARL where other state-of-the-art methods can suffer from sample inefficiency or fail entirely. All codes can be found here: https://github.com/Nikunj-Gupta/dmcg-marl.</p></details> |  |

We expand this 'cake that is intelligence' analogy from a simple structural metaphor to the full life-cycle of AI systems, extending it to sourcing of ingredients (data), conception of recipes (instructions), the baking process (training), and the tasting and selling of the cake (evaluation and distribution). Leveraging our re-conceptualization, we describe each step's entailed social ramifications and how they are bounded by statistical assumptions within machine learning. Whereas these technical foundations and social impacts are deeply intertwined, they are often studied in isolation, creating barriers that restrict meaningful participation. Our re-conceptualization paves the way to bridge this gap by mapping where technical foundations interact with social outcomes, highlighting opportunities for cross-disciplinary dialogue. Finally, we conclude with actionable recommendations at each stage of the metaphorical AI cake's life-cycle, empowering prospective AI practitioners, users, and researchers, with increased awareness and ability to engage in broader AI discourse.</p></details> |  |

While traditional controllers based on tire models are reliable, they often demand extensive tuning or system identification. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods offer significant potential due to their ability to learn directly from interaction, yet they typically suffer from the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulation fail to perform effectively in the real world. In this paper, we propose RLPP, a residual RL framework that enhances a Pure Pursuit (PP) controller with an RL-based residual. This hybrid approach leverages the reliability and interpretability of PP while using RL to fine-tune the controller's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive testing on the F1TENTH platform demonstrates that RLPP improves lap times of the baseline controllers by up to 6.37 %, closing the gap to the State-of-the-Art methods by more than 52 % and providing reliable performance in zero-shot real-world deployment, overcoming key challenges associated with the sim-to-real transfer and reducing the performance gap from simulation to reality by more than 8-fold when compared to the baseline RL controller. The RLPP framework is made available as an open-source tool, encouraging further exploration and advancement in autonomous racing research.

Essentially, it proactively takes the uncertainties associated with surrounding vehicles (SVs) into consideration, which encompass those stemming from the driver's intention, interactive behaviors, and the varying number of SVs. Intermediate decision variables are introduced to enable the high-level RL policy to provide an interaction-aware reference, for guiding low-level model predictive control (MPC) and further enhancing the generalization ability of the proposed framework. By leveraging the structured nature of self-driving at unsignalized intersections, the training problem of the RL policy is modeled as a bilevel curriculum learning task, which is addressed by the proposed Exp3.S-based BiMAB algorithm. It is noteworthy that the training curricula are dynamically adjusted, thereby facilitating the sample efficiency of the RL training process. Comparative experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, and the results indicate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to all baseline methods. Furthermore, experimental results in two new urban driving scenarios clearly demonstrate the commendable generalization performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

This paper introduces fairness in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a penalty term derived from demographic parity, counterfactual fairness, and conditional statistical parity. The proposed method balances reward maximisation with fairness by integrating two penalty components: a retrospective component that minimises disparities in past outcomes and a prospective component that ensures fairness in future decision-making. We evaluate our approach in the Allelopathic Harvest game, a cooperative and competitive MAS focused on resource collection, where some agents possess a sensitive attribute. Experiments demonstrate that fair-PPO achieves fairer policies across all fairness metrics than classic PPO. Fairness comes at the cost of reduced rewards, namely the Price of Fairness, although agents with and without the sensitive attribute renounce comparable amounts of rewards. Additionally, the retrospective and prospective penalties effectively change the agents' behaviour and improve fairness. These findings underscore the potential of fair-PPO to address fairness challenges in MAS.</p></details> |  |

While automated machine learning pipelines are starting to recognize and integrate data preprocessing into their solutions for classification and regression tasks, this integration is lacking for more specialized tasks like survival or time-to-event models. As a result, survival analysis not only faces the general challenges of data preprocessing but also suffers from the lack of tailored, automated solutions in this area. To address this gap, this paper presents 'CleanSurvival', a reinforcement-learning-based solution for optimizing preprocessing pipelines, extended specifically for survival analysis. The framework can handle continuous and categorical variables, using Q-learning to select which combination of data imputation, outlier detection and feature extraction techniques achieves optimal performance for a Cox, random forest, neural network or user-supplied time-to-event model. The package is available on GitHub: https://github.com/datasciapps/CleanSurvival Experimental benchmarks on real-world datasets show that the Q-learning-based data preprocessing results in superior predictive performance to standard approaches, finding such a model up to 10 times faster than undirected random grid search. Furthermore, a simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness in different types and levels of missingness and noise in the data.</p></details> |  |

Mirror Descent Value Iteration (MDVI) uses both Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy as regularizers in its value and policy updates. Despite its empirical success in discrete action domains and strong theoretical guarantees, the performance of a MDVI-based method does not surpass an entropy-only-regularized method in continuous action domains. In this study, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style instantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its empirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's log-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded naive instantiation. Further, we relate MDAC to Advantage Learning by recalling that the actor's log-probability is equal to the regularized advantage function in tabular cases, and theoretically discuss when and why bounding the advantage terms is validated and beneficial. We also empirically explore a good choice for the bounding function, and show that MDAC perfoms better than strong non-regularized and entropy-only-regularized methods with an appropriate choice of the bounding function.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with communication methods lack evaluation metrics for information weights and information-level communication modeling. This causes agents to neglect the aggregation of multiple messages, thereby significantly reducing policy learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose pluggable adaptive generative networks (PAGNet), a novel framework that integrates generative models into MARL to enhance communication and decision-making. PAGNet enables agents to synthesize global states representations from weighted local observations and use these representations alongside learned communication weights for coordinated decision-making. This pluggable approach reduces the computational demands typically associated with the joint training of communication and policy networks. Extensive experimental evaluations across diverse benchmarks and communication scenarios demonstrate the significant performance improvements achieved by PAGNet. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent communication patterns and the quality of generated global states, providing insights into operational mechanisms.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with smaller Lipschitz bounds are more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. However, the structure of the Lipschitz layer is important. We find that the widely-used method of spectral normalization is too conservative and severely impacts clean performance, whereas more expressive Lipschitz layers such as the recently-proposed Sandwich layer can achieve improved robustness without sacrificing clean performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Symposium on Systems Theory in Data and Optimization (SysDO 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient IAM Greybox Penetration Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14540v6)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an access control service in cloud platforms. To securely manage cloud resources, customers need to configure IAM to specify the access control rules for their cloud organizations. However, misconfigured IAM can lead to privilege escalation (PE) attacks, causing significant economic loss. Third-party cloud security services detect such issues using whitebox penetration testing, which requires full access to IAM configurations. However, since these configurations often contain sensitive data, customers must manually anonymize them to protect their privacy. To address the dual challenges of anonymization and data privacy, we introduce TAC, the first greybox penetration testing approach for third-party services to efficiently detect IAM PEs. Instead of requiring customers to blindly anonymize their entire IAM configuration, TAC intelligently interacts with customers by querying only a small fraction of information in the IAM configuration that is necessary for PE detection. To achieve this, TAC integrates two key innovations: (1) a comprehensive IAM modeling approach to detect a wide range of IAM PEs using partial information collected from query responses, and (2) a query optimization mechanism leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to minimize customer inputs. Additionally, to address the scarcity of real-world IAM PE datasets, we introduce IAMVulGen, a synthesizer that generates a large number of diverse IAM PEs that mimic real-world scenarios. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that TAC, as a greybox approach, achieves competitively low and, in some cases, significantly lower false negative rates than state-ofthe-art whitebox approaches, while utilizing a limited number of queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Reward Machines from Partially Observed Optimal Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03762v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning is the problem of inferring a reward function from an optimal policy. In this work, it is assumed that the reward is expressed as a reward machine whose transitions depend on atomic propositions associated with the state of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our goal is to identify the true reward machine using finite information. To this end, we first introduce the notion of a prefix tree policy which associates a distribution of actions to each state of the MDP and each attainable finite sequence of atomic propositions. Then, we characterize an equivalence class of reward machines that can be identified given the prefix tree policy. Finally, we propose a SAT-based algorithm that uses information extracted from the prefix tree policy to solve for a reward machine. It is proved that if the prefix tree policy is known up to a sufficient (but finite) depth, our algorithm recovers the exact reward machine up to the equivalence class. This sufficient depth is derived as a function of the number of MDP states and (an upper bound on) the number of states of the reward machine. Several examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, resulting in unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To overcome this, we propose Prioritized Refinement for Skill-Based Meta-RL (PRISM), a robust framework that integrates exploration near noisy data to generate online trajectories and combines them with offline data. Through prioritization, PRISM extracts high-quality data to learn task-relevant skills effectively. By addressing the impact of noise, our method ensures stable skill learning and achieves superior performance in long-horizon tasks, even with noisy and sub-optimal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main, 19 pages appendix with reference.

However, the practical application of CDRL is encumbered by challenging projection steps, detailed parameter tuning, and domain knowledge. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a pioneering Continuous Distributional Model-Free RL algorithm tailored for continuous action spaces. The proposed algorithm simplifies the implementation of distributional RL, adopting an actor-critic architecture wherein the critic outputs a continuous probability distribution. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of multiple critics fused through a Kalman fusion mechanism to mitigate overestimation bias. Through a series of experiments, we validate that our proposed method provides a sample-efficient solution for executing complex continuous-control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenSTARLab: Open Approach for Spatio-Temporal Agent Data Analysis in Soccer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02785v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

Certified robustness, which provides provable guarantees about a model's ability to withstand different adversarial perturbations, has rarely been addressed in quantization due to unacceptably high cost of certifying robustness. This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms. ARQ consistently performs better than multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. The performance of ARQ quantized networks reaches that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions and the highest certified radius.

| **[Speaking the Language of Teamwork: LLM-Guided Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03723v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit assignment, the process of attributing credit or blame to individual agents for their contributions to a team's success or failure, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly in environments with sparse rewards. Commonly-used approaches such as value decomposition often lead to suboptimal policies in these settings, and designing dense reward functions that align with human intuition can be complex and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel framework where a large language model (LLM) generates dense, agent-specific rewards based on a natural language description of the task and the overall team goal. By learning a potential-based reward function over multiple queries, our method reduces the impact of ranking errors while allowing the LLM to evaluate each agent's contribution to the overall task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns compared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | 26 pages |

While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, their ability to perform complex reasoning-spanning logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense inference, and multi-step reasoning-often falls short of human expectations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We categorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought reasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models, modular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore evaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open challenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization across diverse tasks.

This paper compares such GPU-based methods with classical CPU-based methods on Maximum Independent Set (MIS). Experiments on standard graph families show that AI-based algorithms fail to outperform and, in many cases, to match the solution quality of the state-of-art classical solver KaMIS running on a single CPU. Some GPU-based methods even perform similarly to the simplest heuristic, degree-based greedy. Even with post-processing techniques like local search, AI-based methods still perform worse than CPU-based solvers. We develop a new mode of analysis to reveal that non-backtracking AI methods, e.g. LTFT (which is based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy approach, and thus worse than KaMIS. We also find that CPU-based algorithms, notably KaMIS, have strong performance on sparse random graphs, which appears to refute a well-known conjectured upper bound for efficient algorithms from Coja-Oghlan & Efthymiou (2015).</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

While predictive models may not directly translate to effective design, recent MBO algorithms incorporate reinforcement learning and generative modeling approaches. Meanwhile, theoretical work suggests that exploiting the target function's structure can enhance MBO performance. We present Cliqueformer, a transformer-based architecture that learns the black-box function's structure through functional graphical models (FGM), addressing distribution shift without relying on explicit conservative approaches. Across various domains, including chemical and genetic design tasks, Cliqueformer demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Computational models of predicting scanpaths on charts could complement empirical studies by offering estimates of user performance inexpensively; however, previous models have been limited to gaze patterns and overlooked the effects of tasks. Here, we contribute Chartist, a computational model that simulates how users move their eyes to extract information from the chart in order to perform analysis tasks, including value retrieval, filtering, and finding extremes. The novel contribution lies in a two-level hierarchical control architecture. At the high level, the model uses LLMs to comprehend the information gained so far and applies this representation to select a goal for the lower-level controllers, which, in turn, move the eyes in accordance with a sampling policy learned via reinforcement learning. The model is capable of predicting human-like task-driven scanpaths across various tasks. It can be applied in fields such as explainable AI, visualization design evaluation, and optimization. While it displays limitations in terms of generalizability and accuracy, it takes modeling in a promising direction, toward understanding human behaviors in interacting with charts.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental challenge in analyzing a stochastic approximation algorithm is to establish its stability, i.e., to show that the stochastic vector iterates are bounded almost surely. In this paper, we extend the celebrated Borkar-Meyn theorem for stability from the Martingale difference noise setting to the Markovian noise setting, which greatly improves its applicability in reinforcement learning, especially in those off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and eligibility traces. Central to our analysis is the diminishing asymptotic rate of change of a few functions, which is implied by both a form of the strong law of large numbers and a form of the law of the iterated logarithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 2025</p></details> |

However, we discover that existing methods that rely on standard SAC-style policy iteration for value learning, directly using data generated by the planner, often result in \emph{persistent value overestimation}. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we argue that this issue is deeply rooted in the structural policy mismatch between the data generation policy that is always bootstrapped by the planner and the learned policy prior. To mitigate such a mismatch in a minimalist way, we propose a policy regularization term reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) queries, thereby improving value learning. Our method involves minimum changes on top of existing frameworks and requires no additional computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves performance over baselines such as TD-MPC2 by large margins, particularly in 61-DoF humanoid tasks.

Research indicates that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs typically retain considerable residual capacity, offering extended utility. These batteries can be effectively repurposed for use in EV charging stations (EVCS), providing a cost-effective alternative to new batteries and reducing overall planning costs. Integrating battery energy storage systems (BESS) with SLBs into EVCS is a promising strategy to alleviate system overload. However, efficient operation of EVCS with integrated BESS is hindered by uncertainties such as fluctuating EV arrival and departure times and variable power prices from the grid. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) planning framework for EV charging stations with BESS, leveraging SLBs. We employ the advanced soft actor-critic (SAC) approach, training the model on a year's worth of data to account for seasonal variations, including weekdays and holidays. A tailored reward function enables effective offline training, allowing real-time optimization of EVCS operations under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures, Accepted, 2025 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM 2025), Austin, TX, USA</p></details> |

Integrating secure communication through authentication introduces additional computational and communication overhead, significantly impacting offloading efficiency and latency. This paper presents a unified framework incorporating lightweight Identity-Based Cryptographic (IBC) authentication into task offloading within cloud-based 6G Vehicular Twin Networks (VTNs). Utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), our approach optimizes authenticated offloading decisions to minimize latency and enhance resource allocation. Performance evaluation under varying network sizes, task sizes, and data rates reveals that IBC authentication can reduce offloading efficiency by up to 50% due to the added overhead. Besides, increasing network size and task size can further reduce offloading efficiency by up to 91.7%. As a countermeasure, increasing the transmission data rate can improve the offloading performance by as much as 63%, even in the presence of authentication overhead.

This rise in energy demand poses significant challenges to resource availability and raises sustainability concerns for large-scale IoT deployments. Efficient energy utilization in communication networks, particularly for power-constrained IoT devices, has thus become a critical area of research. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways (GWs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices (EDs) and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the global system energy efficiency (EE) of wireless LoRa networks by joint optimization of transmission power (TP), spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (W), and ED association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly improves the global system EE and surpasses the conventional MARL schemes.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning, identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

The interaction and corrective feedback from human brings safety and AI alignment to the learning process. In this work, we propose a new reward-free active human involvement method called Proxy Value Propagation for policy optimization. Our key insight is that a proxy value function can be designed to express human intents, wherein state-action pairs in the human demonstration are labeled with high values, while those agents' actions that are intervened receive low values. Through the TD-learning framework, labeled values of demonstrated state-action pairs are further propagated to other unlabeled data generated from agents' exploration. The proxy value function thus induces a policy that faithfully emulates human behaviors. Human-in-the-loop experiments show the generality and efficiency of our method. With minimal modification to existing reinforcement learning algorithms, our method can learn to solve continuous and discrete control tasks with various human control devices, including the challenging task of driving in Grand Theft Auto V.

In this paper, we formalize the game equilibrium problem as an optimization problem that splits into two subproblems with respect to policy and value function, which are solved respectively by interior point method and dynamic programming. Combining these two parts, we obtain an FPTAS (fully PTAS) for the weak approximation (approximating to an $\epsilon$-equilibrium) of any perfect equilibrium of any dynamic game, implying PPAD=FP since the weak approximation problem is PPAD-complete. In addition, we introduce a geometric object called equilibrium bundle, regarding which, first, perfect equilibria of dynamic games are formalized as zero points of its canonical section, second, the hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method is formalized as a line search on it, third, it derives the existence and oddness theorems as an extension of those of Nash equilibria.

Exogenous states evolve stochastically, independent of the agent's actions, while endogenous states evolve deterministically based on both state components and actions. Exo-MDPs are useful for applications including inventory control, portfolio management, and ride-sharing. Our first result is structural, establishing a representational equivalence between the classes of discrete MDPs, Exo-MDPs, and discrete linear mixture MDPs. Specifically, any discrete MDP can be represented as an Exo-MDP, and the transition and reward dynamics can be written as linear functions of the exogenous state distribution, showing that Exo-MDPs are instances of linear mixture MDPs. For unobserved exogenous states, we prove a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{K})$ over $K$ trajectories of horizon $H$, with $d$ as the size of the exogenous state space, and establish nearly-matching lower bounds. Our findings demonstrate how Exo-MDPs decouple sample complexity from action and endogenous state sizes, and we validate our theoretical insights with experiments on inventory control.</p></details> | 43 pages |

Such resource allocation problems are often modeled as restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) with unknown underlying transition dynamics, hence requiring online reinforcement learning (RL). We present Bayesian Learning for Contextual RMABs (BCoR), an online RL approach for RMABs that novelly combines techniques in Bayesian modeling with Thompson sampling to flexibly model the complex RMAB settings present in public health program adherence problems, namely context and non-stationarity. BCoR's key strength is the ability to leverage shared information within and between arms to learn the unknown RMAB transition dynamics quickly in intervention-scarce settings with relatively short time horizons, which is common in public health applications. Empirically, BCoR achieves substantially higher finite-sample performance over a range of experimental settings, including a setting using real-world adherence data that was developed in collaboration with ARMMAN, an NGO in India which runs a large-scale maternal mHealth program, showcasing BCoR practical utility and potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |

A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> |

Among them, RL agents are efficient for deployment but only perform very few tasks. By contrast, giant LLM agents (often more than 1000B parameters) present strong generalization while demanding enormous computing resources. In this work, we combine their advantages while avoiding the drawbacks by conducting the proposed referee RL on our developed large auto-regressive model (LARM). Specifically, LARM is built upon a lightweight LLM (fewer than 5B parameters) and directly outputs the next action to execute rather than text. We mathematically reveal that classic RL feedbacks vanish in long-horizon embodied exploration and introduce a giant LLM based referee to handle this reward vanishment during training LARM. In this way, LARM learns to complete diverse open-world tasks without human intervention. Especially, LARM successfully harvests enchanted diamond equipment in Minecraft, which demands significantly longer decision-making chains than the highest achievements of prior best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Underwater Soft Fin Flapping Motion with Deep Neural Network Based Surrogate Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03135v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel framework for precise force control of fin-actuated underwater robots by integrating a deep neural network (DNN)-based surrogate model with reinforcement learning (RL). To address the complex interactions with the underwater environment and the high experimental costs, a DNN surrogate model acts as a simulator for enabling efficient training for the RL agent. Additionally, grid-switching control is applied to select optimized models for specific force reference ranges, improving control accuracy and stability. Experimental results show that the RL agent, trained in the surrogate simulation, generates complex thrust motions and achieves precise control of a real soft fin actuator. This approach provides an efficient control solution for fin-actuated robots in challenging underwater environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics 2025 (Robosoft)</p></details> |
